In particular, we will look into iterative maximum likelihood parameter estimation based on expectation maximization algorithm and its application in coherent optical communication systems for linear and nonlinear impairment mitigation. Furthermore, the estimated parameters are used to build the probabilistic model of the system for the synthetic impairment generation. It is shown numerically and experimentally that iterative parameter estimation based on expectation maximization algorithm is a powerful tool in combating system impairments such as non-linear phase noise, inphase and quadrature (I/Q) modulator imperfections and laser linewidth. We show experimentally that for a dispersion managed polarization multiplexed 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) system at 14 Gbaud a gain in the nonlinear system tolerance of up to 3 dB can be obtained. For, a dispersion unmanaged system this gain reduces to 0.5 dB. Moreover, we show that joint estimation of carrier frequency, phase, signal means and noise covariance, can be performed iteratively by employing expectation maximization. Using experimental data we show that joint carrier synchronization and detection offers an improvement of 0.5 dB in terms of input power compared to hard decision digital phaselocked loop (PLL) based carrier synchronization and demodulation.","2219-5491;22195491","Electronic:978-0-9928-6261-9; POD:978-1-4799-4603-7; USB:978-0-9928-6262-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6952698","expectation maximization;machine learning;nonlinear impairments;optical communication","Abstracts;Communities;Optical modulation;Optical polarization;Optical sensors","expectation-maximisation algorithm;maximum likelihood estimation;modulators;optical communication;phase locked loops;quadrature amplitude modulation;signal processing;synchronisation","16-quadrature amplitude modulation system;I-Q modulator;PLL based carrier synchronization;PLL based demodulation;carrier frequency estimation;coherent optical communication;digital phase-locked loop;dispersion managed polarization multiplexed QAM system;expectation maximization algorithm;inphase and quadrature modulator imperfections;iterative maximum likelihood parameter estimation;joint carrier detection;joint carrier synchronization;laser linewidth;linear impairment mitigation;machine learning;noise covariance;nonlinear impairment mitigation;nonlinear phase noise;phase signal means estimation;probabilistic model;statistical signal processing method;synthetic impairment generation","","0","","5","","","1-5 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce a static technique to characterize a program using a pattern-driven system named HERCULES. This characterization technique not only helps a user to understand programs by searching pattern-of-interests, but also can be used for a predictive model that effectively selects the proper compiler optimizations. We formulated 35 loop patterns, then evaluated our characterization technique by comparing the predictive models constructed using HERCULES to three other state-of-the-art characterization methods.

First, SR is performed using full pixel accuracy motion vectors obtained using full search block matching algorithm (FS-BMA). Then, machine learning based method is applied on the resulting images in order to detect and classify artifacts introduced due to missing subpixel components of the motion vectors.

Physical inactivity is the leading cause of many diseases. It has been estimated that as many as 250,000 deaths per year in the United States, approximately 12% of the total, are attributable to a lack of regular physical activity. Measuring physical activities and counting steps is an effective method to diagnose some diseases. It can also serve as an effective method to encourage people to increase their physical activity. Pedometers have been invented as a convenient way of counting steps. However most of them lack the functionality of differentiating activities. Pressure sensor pads can measure steps and gait, but as the pad has a limited size, it can not meet the need of anytime and anywhere usage. In this study, we made the Sensor Socks for measuring physical activities and counting steps. It is unobtrusive and convenient for everyday usage.

There are several methods (see: [2, 3, 4, 1] for details) which couple information about the location of archaeological remnants and variables derived from natural datasets and social and economic variables. These methods use Geographic Information Science technology and statistical algorithms and result in maps of past human activity. Correct models require the user to know the importance of variables what is difficult to proceed on insensibly contrasted areas like temperate lowlands (Jasiewicz, Hildebrandt-Radke 2009). and requires a large amount of representative data so its application is limited only to well recognized areas where data representativeness is not questionable - which does not occur very often. Furthermore, archaeological remnants tend to be clustered also that some areas were examined more thoroughly than others. This leads to the problem of data imbalance.

Existing approaches learn from multi-label data by manipulating with identical feature set, i.e. the very instance representation of each example is employed in the discrimination processes of all class labels. However, this popular strategy might be suboptimal as each label is supposed to possess specific characteristics of its own. In this paper, another strategy to learn from multi-label data is studied, where label-specific features are exploited to benefit the discrimination of different class labels. Accordingly, an intuitive yet effective algorithm named LIFT, i.e. multi-label learning with Label specific Features, is proposed. LIFT firstly constructs features specific to each label by conducting clustering analysis on its positive and negative instances, and then performs training and testing by querying the clustering results. Comprehensive experiments on a total of 17 benchmark data sets clearly validate the superiority of LIFT against other well-established multi-label learning algorithms as well as the effectiveness of label-specific features.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2339815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857380","Machine learning;label correlations;label-specific features;multi-label learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Measurement;Text categorization;Training;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","LIFT;clustering analysis;multi label learning with label specific feature algorithm","","19","","60","","20140716","Jan. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The recognition performance can be significantly improved by decreasing the number of categories to be analyzed. The authors studied several labeling methods to categorize and group loads in order to increase the overall recognition rate. 31 different devices have been measured and labeled in different device states. Their input curves have been compared with 5 different machine learning algorithms. The best results could be reached by dividing all the loads into groups with small divergence in their normalized current curve.

It's very tedious for a service consumer to select the appropriate one according to her/his needs. In this paper, we propose a non-logic-based matchmaking approach that uses the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) to extract topic from semantic service descriptions and model the correlation between the extracted topics. Based on the topic correlation, service descriptions can be grouped into hierarchical clusters. In our approach, we use the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) formalism to organize the constructed hierarchical clusters into concept lattices according to their topics. Thus, service discovery may be achieved more easily using the concept lattice. In our approach, topic models are used as efficient dimension reduction techniques, which are able to capture semantic relationships between word-topic and topic-service interpreted in terms of probability distributions. In our experiment, we compared the accuracy of the our hierarchical clustering algorithm with that of a classical hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The comparisons of Precision@n and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCGn) values for our approach, Apache lucene and SAWSDL-MX2 Matchmaker indicate that the method based on CTM presented in this paper outperform all the others matchmakers in terms of ranking of the most relevant services.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5054-6; POD:978-1-4799-5055-3","10.1109/ICWS.2014.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928893","Data Representation;Discovery and ranking;Formal Concept Analysis;Hierarchical Clustering;Machine Learning;Topic Models;Web service","Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Lattices;Mathematical model;Power capacitors;Semantics;Web services","Web services;data mining;formal concept analysis;pattern clustering;statistical distributions","Apache lucene;CTM;FCA;NDCGn value;SAWSDL-MX2 Matchmaker;Web services;concept lattices;correlated topic model;dimension reduction techniques;formal concept analysis;hierarchical agglomerative clustering;hierarchical clustering algorithm;nonlogic-based matchmaking approach;normalised discounted cumulative gain;probability distribution;service clustering;service consumer;service descriptions;service discovery;topic correlation;topic-service;word-topic","","8","","19","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, studies have attempted to estimate affective movie content with computational features, but results have been mixed, one of the main reasons being a lack of data on perceptual stylistic and aesthetic attributes of film, which would provide a ground truth for the features. The distinctions between energetic and tense arousal as well as perceived and felt affect are also often neglected. In this study, we present a data set of ratings by 73 viewers of 83 stylistic, aesthetic, and affective attributes for a selection of movie clips containing complete scenes taken from mainstream movies. The affective attributes include the temporal progression of perceived and felt valence and arousal within the clips. The data set is aimed to be used to train algorithms that predict viewer assessments based on low-level computational features. With this data set, we performed a baseline study modeling the relation between a large selection of low-level computational features (i.e., visual, auditory, and temporal) and perceptual stylistic, aesthetic, and affective attributes of movie clips. Two algorithms were compared in a realistic prediction scenario: linear regression and the neural-network-based Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Felt and perceived affect as well as stylistic attributes were shown to be equally easy to predict, whereas the prediction of aesthetic attributes failed. The performance of the ELM predictor was overall found to be slightly better than the linear regression. A feature selection experiment illustrated that features from all low-level computational modalities, visual, auditory and temporal, contribute to the prediction of the affect assessments. We have made our assessment data and extracted computational features publicly available.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2014.2357688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6898024","Aesthetics;content-based analysis;felt affect;film;machine learning;modeling;perceived affect;style","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Motion pictures;Prediction methods","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;regression analysis;video retrieval","aesthetic attributes;affective attributes;affective movie content;computational feature extraction;feature selection experiment;linear regression;low-level computational features;movie clips;movie style content-based prediction;neural-network-based ELM;neural-network-based extreme learning machine;perceptual stylistic attributes;viewer assessment prediction","","2","","80","","20140912","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Functional properties, in turn, can be described by means of a formal specification language. State-space based planning approaches can then be applied to solve the underlying composition problem. However, depending on the expressiveness of the applied formalism and the completeness of the functional descriptions, formally equivalent services may still differ with respect to their implemented functionality. As a consequence, the most appropriate solution for a desired functionality can hardly be determined without considering additional information. In this paper, we demonstrate how to overcome this lack of information by means of Reinforcement Learning. In order to resolve ambiguity, we expand state-space based service composition by a recommendation mechanism that supports decision-making beyond formal specifications. The recommendation mechanism adjusts its recommendation strategy based on feedback from previous composition runs. Image processing serves as case study. Experimental results show the benefit of our proposed solution.","2163-2871;21632871","Electronic:978-1-4799-6833-6; POD:978-1-4799-6834-3","10.1109/SOCA.2014.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6978597","Machine Learning;Reinforcement Learning;Service Composition;Service Functionality;Service Recommendation","Concrete;Context;Decision making;Image processing;Learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;Planning","formal specification;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;recommender systems","decision-making;formal specification language;functional descriptions;individual user requests;nonfunctional properties;optimization problem;recommendation mechanism;reinforcement learning application;service composition;state space based planning;state-space based service composition","","0","","25","","","17-19 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automatic image annotation is an important task for multimedia retrieval. By automatically allocating semantic concepts to un-annotated images, image retrieval can be performed over annotation concepts. In this work, we address the problem of automatic image annotation, namely automatically describing semantic content of image by concept classifier. Traditional approaches mainly consider the link between image and concept, but ignore the link between annotation concepts. We propose a novel Google Semantic link based image Annotation Model (GSAM), which can leverage the associated concept network (ACN) to enhance automatic semantic annotation performance. When several concepts appear in training set with high co-occurrence frequency, our model utilizes Google semantic link to increase the chances of predicting one concept if there is strong visual evidence for others. Additionally, the fusion between Google concept link and local concept link, and semantic links between single-concepts and multi-concepts are employed to improve annotation performance. In order to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on Corel and IAPR datasets. The experimental results show that our approach considering semantic link outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6715-5; POD:978-1-4799-6716-2","10.1109/SKG.2014.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6964687","Google distance;automatic semantic annotation;machine learning;semantic link","Correlation;Google;Mathematical model;Semantics;Training;Visualization;Vocabulary","image classification;image retrieval;search engines","Corel dataset;GSAM model;Google Semantic link;IAPR dataset;automatic image annotation;concept classifier;multimedia content;multimedia retrieval;semantic concepts","","1","","36","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RF and ERT are two ensemble methods for generating predictive models that are of high importance within machine learning. They operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting a prediction by comparing the outputs of the individual trees. Thanks to the inherent parallelism of the task, an obvious platform for its computation is to employ contemporary GPUs with a large number of processing cores. Previous parallel algorithms for RF in the literature are either designed for traditional multi-core CPU platforms or early history GPUs with simpler architecture and relatively few cores. For ERT, only briefly sketched parallelization attempts exist in the literature. The new parallel algorithms are designed for contemporary GPUs with a large number of cores and take into account aspects of the newer hardware architectures, such as memory hierarchy and thread scheduling. They are implemented using the C/C++ language and the CUDA interface to attain the best possible performance on NVidia-based GPUs.

This system utilizes multiple advanced computational approaches including the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrologic model for watershed simulations, interactive genetic algorithms and reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms for search and optimization, and deep learning artificial neural networks for user modeling, within an encompassing human-computer interaction framework. A substantial user study of the WRESTORE system was conducted recently involving multiple real stakeholders varying from consultants, government officials, watershed alliance members, etc., with the objective of gaining insight about WRESTORE'S usability and utility. In particular focus was the user modeling component that develops a computational model of a user's preferences and criteria, based on real-time user-provided ratings for a subset of possible designs (similar to the idea of user profiling commonly done for human-computer interaction systems). The user model constructed based on the real user's personalized feedbacks can then be used to influence the automated search and optimization for BMP alternatives in WRESTORE. In this paper, we describe the methods developed for user modeling for interactive optimization, and the experimental set-up as well as results with real user studies.

Gleaned from recent advances in computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning, computational intelligence based racial face analysis has been particularly popular due to its significant potential and broader impacts in extensive real-world applications, such as security and defense, surveillance, human computer interface (HCI), biometric-based identification, among others. These studies raise an important question: How implicit, non-declarative racial category can be conceptually modeled and quantitatively inferred from the face? Nevertheless, race classification is challenging due to its ambiguity and complexity depending on context and criteria. To address this challenge, recently, significant efforts have been reported toward race detection and categorization in the community. This survey provides a comprehensive and critical review of the state-of-the-art advances in face-race perception, principles, algorithms, and applications.

In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift in the research of decision trees: instead of proposing a new manually designed method for inducing decision trees, we propose automatically designing decision-tree induction algorithms tailored to a specific type of classification data set (or application domain). Following recent breakthroughs in the automatic design of machine learning algorithms, we propose a hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm called hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm for designing decision-tree algorithms (HEAD-DT) that evolves design components of top-down decision-tree induction algorithms. By the end of the evolution, we expect HEAD-DT to generate a new and possibly better decision-tree algorithm for a given application domain. We perform extensive experiments in 35 real-world microarray gene expression data sets to assess the performance of HEAD-DT, and compare it with very well known decision-tree algorithms such as C4.5, CART, and REPTree. Results show that HEAD-DT is capable of generating algorithms that significantly outperform the baseline manually designed decision-tree algorithms regarding predictive accuracy and F-measure.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2013.2291813","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6670778","Automatic algorithm design;automatic algorithm design;classification;decision trees;evolutionary algorithms;hyper-heuristics;hyperheuristics;machine learning","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Decision trees;Evolutionary computation;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Training","biology computing;decision trees;evolutionary computation;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","F-measure;HEAD-DT algorithm;application domain;classification data set;decision-tree algorithms;decision-tree induction algorithms;evolutionary design;greedy top-down recursive approach;hyperheuristic evolutionary algorithm;machine learning applications;microarray gene expression data set","","7","","55","","20131120","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This work is focused on making the process of turning the streetlights on and off more intelligent so that they consume less power and cause less light pollution. The proposed solution is comprised of a radar device and an expert system implemented on a low-cost platform based on a DSP. By analyzing the radar echo in both the frequency and time domains, the system is able to detect and identify objects moving in front of it. This information is used to decide whether or not the streetlight should be turned on. Experimental results show that the proposed system can provide hit rates over 80% promising a good performance.

Methods used to tackle data classification and linkage problems fall into two broad categories. One commonly used method is deterministic models, in which sets of often very complex rules are used to classify pairs of entities as links. The other is the probabilistic model, in which statistical or probabilistic approaches are used to classify pairs. However, these models fail to deliver when there are lots of missing values, typographical errors, non-standardized entities, etc. To this end, intelligent routines making use of artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms and clustering algorithms can provide the next generation models for data classification and linkage. An introduction to data linkage, impact on humanity and community, current models, associated pitfalls, new directions and issues both technical and social for next generation data classification and linkage systems are discussed using an example prototype. A new model for linkage is proposed, where it is highlighted that not only the relationships between attributes of different entities, but also identification of relationships within the attributes of an entity is important in handling missing values and can provide better accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7193-0; POD:978-1-4799-7194-7","10.1109/GHTC.2014.6970340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6970340","Big data;classification;data linkage;machine learning;phonetic matching;probabilistic models;string comparison","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Couplings;Data models;Joining processes;Next generation networking;Probabilistic logic","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;probability","artificial intelligence;artificial neural networks;clustering algorithms;complex rules;data sources;deterministic models;entity attributes;genetic algorithms;information identification;missing value handling;next generation data classification;next generation data linkage;probabilistic approach;probabilistic model;relationship identification;social issues;statistical approach;technical issues","","0","","12","","","10-13 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud users may not have access to their outsourced data in the event of operational failures in datacenters or occurrence of natural disasters and/or power outages. Recently, IP geolocation techniques have been proposed to locate data files in cloud datacenters. However these techniques exploit relationships between Internet delays and distance and are not extensible to incorporate different network measurements, which may be used along with Internet delay to improve accuracy. Also, most of the existing techniques have only been validated with one cloud provider (Amazon Web Services). In this paper, we propose an enhanced learning classifier IP geolocation algorithm, which incorporates multiple network measurements to improve the accuracy of geolocating data files in datacenters in four commercial cloud providers. To demonstrate the accuracy of our approach, we evaluate the performance on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine and Rackspace.

Learned functions presented in the paper have been trained for a commercially available solar panel using MPP data generated using a previously published solar panel simulator. The learned function for maximum power has been validated by comparing the function outputs (GP results) against the manufacturer specified power values.

Certain tasks, however, require that insights derived from visual abstractions are verified by a human expert perusing the source text. So far, this problem is typically solved by offering overview-detail techniques, which present different views with different levels of abstractions. This often leads to problems with visual continuity. Focus-context techniques, on the other hand, succeed in accentuating interesting subsections of large text documents but are normally not suited for integrating visual abstractions. With VarifocalReader we present a technique that helps to solve some of these approaches' problems by combining characteristics from both. In particular, our method simplifies working with large and potentially complex text documents by simultaneously offering abstract representations of varying detail, based on the inherent structure of the document, and access to the text itself. In addition, VarifocalReader supports intra-document exploration through advanced navigation concepts and facilitates visual analysis tasks. The approach enables users to apply machine learning techniques and search mechanisms as well as to assess and adapt these techniques. This helps to extract entities, concepts and other artifacts from texts.

This study presents an algorithm that automatically estimates the AHI value using a disposable HealthPatch<sup>TM</sup> sensor. Volunteers (n=53, AHI: 0.1-85.8) participated in an overnight PSG study with patch sensors attached to their chest at three specified locations and data were wirelessly acquired. Features were computed for 150-second epochs of patch sensor data using analyses of heart rate variability, respiratory signals, posture and movements. Linear Support Vector Machine classifier was trained to detect the presence/absence of apnea/hypopnea events for each epoch. The number of epochs identified with events was subsequently mapped to AHI values using quadratic regression analysis. The classifier and regression models were optimized to minimize the mean-square error of AHI based on leave-one-out cross-validation. Comparison of predicted and reference AHI values resulted in linear correlation coefficients of 0.87, 0.88 and 0.92 for the three locations, respectively. The predicted AHI values were subsequently used to classify the control-to-mild apnea group (AHI<;15) and moderate-to-severe apnea (AHI≥15) with an accuracy (95% confidence intervals) of 89.4% (77.4-95.4%), 85.0% (70.9-92.9%), and 82.9% (67.3-91.9%) for the three locations, respectively.

During last few years lot of work has been done in the field of computer assisted analysis to detect an epileptic activity in an EEG. Still there is a significant amount of need to make these computer assisted EEG analysis systems more convenient and informative for a neurologist. After briefly discussing some of the existing work we have suggested an approach which can make these systems more helpful, detailed and precise for the neurologist. In our proposed approach we have handled each epoch of each channel for each type of epileptic pattern exclusive to each other. In our approach feature extraction starts with an application of multilevel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) on each 1 sec non-overlapping epochs. Then we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the effect of redundant and noisy data. Afterwards we apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify these epochs as Epileptic or not. In our system a user can mark any mistakes he encounters. The concept behind the inclusion of the retraining is that, if there is more than one example with same attributes but different labels, the classifier is going to get trained to the one with most population. These corrective marking will be saved as examples. On retraining the classifier will improve its classification, hence it will tries to adapt the user. In the end we have discussed the results we have acquired till now. Due to limitation in the available data we are only able to report the classification performance for generalised absence seizure. The reported accuracy is resulted on very versatile dataset of 21 patients from Punjab Institute of Mental Health (PIMH) and 21 patients from Children Hospital Boston (CHB) which have different number of channel and sampling frequency. This usage of the data proves the robustness of our algorithm.","1051-4651;10514651","Electronic:978-1-4799-5209-0; POD:978-1-4799-5210-6","10.1109/ICPR.2014.583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977295","Biomedical Signal Processing;Electroencephalography (EEG);Epilepsy;Machine Learning","Accuracy;Discrete wavelet transforms;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines","discrete wavelet transforms;diseases;electroencephalography;image classification;medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology;principal component analysis","DWT;EEG;SVM;channel frequency;computer assisted analysis;electroencephalogram;epilepsy;multilevel discrete wavelet transform;principal component analysis;sampling frequency;support vector machine","","1","","32","","","24-28 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Time-Frequency Analysis as Probabilistic Inference","R. E. Turner; M. Sahani","Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","20141106","2014","62","23","6171","6183","This paper proposes a new view of time-frequency analysis framed in terms of probabilistic inference. Natural signals are assumed to be formed by the superposition of distinct time-frequency components, with the analytic goal being to infer these components by application of Bayes' rule. The framework serves to unify various existing models for natural time-series; it relates to both the Wiener and Kalman filters, and with suitable assumptions yields inferential interpretations of the short-time Fourier transform, spectrogram, filter bank, and wavelet representations. Value is gained by placing time-frequency analysis on the same probabilistic basis as is often employed in applications such as denoising, source separation, or recognition. Uncertainty in the time-frequency representation can be propagated correctly to application-specific stages, improving the handing of noise and missing data. Probabilistic learning allows modules to be co-adapted; thus, the time-frequency representation can be adapted to both the demands of the application and the time-varying statistics of the signal at hand. Similarly, the application module can be adapted to fine properties of the signal propagated by the initial time-frequency processing. We demonstrate these benefits by combining probabilistic time-frequency representations with non-negative matrix factorization, finding benefits in audio denoising and inpainting tasks, albeit with higher computational cost than incurred by the standard approach.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2014.2362100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918491","Audio signal processing;inference;machine- learning;time-frequency analysis","Hidden Markov models;Noise;Noise reduction;Probabilistic logic;Spectrogram;Time-frequency analysis;Uncertainty","Bayes methods;Fourier transforms;Kalman filters;Wiener filters;channel bank filters;matrix decomposition;source separation;time-frequency analysis","Bayes rule;Kalman filters;Wiener filters;computational cost;filter bank;natural signals;natural time-series;nonnegative matrix factorization;probabilistic inference;probabilistic learning;short-time Fourier transform;source separation;time-frequency analysis;time-varying statistics;wavelet representations","","2","","54","","20141008","Dec.1, 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in current visual analytics systems, the computer has limited means of knowing about its users and their analysis processes. While existing research has shown that a user's interactions with a system reflect a large amount of the user's reasoning process, there has been limited advancement in developing automated, real-time techniques that mine interactions to learn about the user. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict a user's task performance and infer some user personality traits by using machine learning techniques to analyze interaction data. Specifically, we conduct an experiment in which participants perform a visual search task, and apply well-known machine learning algorithms to three encodings of the users' interaction data. We achieve, depending on algorithm and encoding, between 62% and 83% accuracy at predicting whether each user will be fast or slow at completing the task. Beyond predicting performance, we demonstrate that using the same techniques, we can infer aspects of the user's personality factors, including locus of control, extraversion, and neuroticism. Further analyses show that strong results can be attained with limited observation time: in one case 95% of the final accuracy is gained after a quarter of the average task completion time. Overall, our findings show that interactions can provide information to the computer about its human collaborator, and establish a foundation for realizing mixed-initiative visual analytics systems.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6875913","Analytic Provenance;Applied Machine Learning;User Interactions;Visualization","Accuracy;Computers;Data visualization;Encoding;Mice;Visual analytics","data analysis;data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence)","Finding Waldo;average task completion time;extraversion;human collaborator;machine learning algorithms;mine interactions;mixed initiative visual analytics systems;neuroticism;user interaction data analysis;user personality factors;user personality traits;visual search task","0","15","","47","","","Dec. 31 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Everyday, millions of messages are created, commented, and shared by people on social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. This provides valuable data for researchers and practitioners in many application domains, such as marketing, to inform decision-making. Distilling valuable social signals from the huge crowd's messages, however, is challenging, due to the heterogeneous and dynamic crowd behaviors. The challenge is rooted in data analysts' capability of discerning the anomalous information behaviors, such as the spreading of rumors or misinformation, from the rest that are more conventional patterns, such as popular topics and newsworthy events, in a timely fashion. FluxFlow incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, and offers a set of novel visualization designs for presenting the detected threads for deeper analysis. We evaluated FluxFlow with real datasets containing the Twitter feeds captured during significant events such as Hurricane Sandy. Through quantitative measurements of the algorithmic performance and qualitative interviews with domain experts, the results show that the back-end anomaly detection model is effective in identifying anomalous retweeting threads, and its front-end interactive visualizations are intuitive and useful for analysts to discover insights in data and comprehend the underlying analytical model.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876013","Retweeting threads;anomaly detection;information visualization;machine learning;social media;visual analytics","Data visualization;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Media;Message systems;Social network services;Twitter;Visual analytics","data analysis;data visualisation;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","#FluxFlow;Facebook;Hurricane Sandy;Twitter;advanced machine learning algorithms;anomalous information behaviors;anomalous information spreading;anomalous retweeting threads;back-end anomaly detection model;crowd messages;data analyst capability;decision-making;deeper analysis;dynamic crowd behaviors;front-end interactive visualizations;interactive visual analysis system;quantitative measurements;social media Websites;social signals","1","18","","48","","","Dec. 31 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These approaches have been applied to one of the most used PD datasets, which contains repeated measurements in an imbalanced design. Most of the published methodologies applied to perform classification from this dataset fail to account for the dependent nature of the data. This fact artificially increases the sample size and leads to a diffuse criterion to define which subject is suffering from PD. The first proposed approach is based on data aggregation. This reduces the sample size, but defines a clear criterion to discriminate subjects. The second one handles repeated measurements by introducing latent variables in a Bayesian logistic regression framework.

However, it still faces a problem in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments, in which range estimates based on time-of-arrival (TOA) are positively biased. There are many techniques that try to address this problem, mainly based on NLOS identification and NLOS error mitigation. However, these techniques do not exploit all available information from the UWB channel impulse response. In this paper, we propose a novel ranging technique based on kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), in which the selected channel parameters are projected onto nonlinear orthogonal high-dimensional space, and a subset of these projections is then used for ranging.

The five spectral features are the linear predictive cepstrum (CEP), mel frequency cepstrum (MFCC), line spectral frequencies (LSF), adaptive component weighted cepstrum (ACW) and the post-filter cepstrum (PFL). The bagging algorithm is used to train the ensemble of kNNs. Fusion is implicitly accomplished by ensemble classification. The LDC emotional prosody speech database is used in all the experiments.

This paper develops a two-step approach to evolving ensembles using genetic programming (GP) for unbalanced data. The first step uses multiobjective (MO) GP to evolve a Pareto-approximated front of GP classifiers to form the ensemble by trading-off the minority and the majority class against each other during learning. The MO component alleviates the reliance on sampling to artificially rebalance the data. The second step, which is the focus this paper, proposes a novel ensemble selection approach using GP to automatically find/choose the best individuals for the ensemble. This new GP approach combines multiple Pareto-approximated front members into a single composite genetic program solution to represent the (optimized) ensemble. This ensemble representation has two main advantages/novelties over traditional genetic algorithm (GA) approaches. First, by limiting the depth of the composite solution trees, we use selection pressure during evolution to find small highly-cooperative groups of individuals for the ensemble. This means that ensemble sizes are not fixed a priori (as in GA), but vary depending on the strength of the base learners. Second, we compare different function set operators in the composite solution trees to explore new ways to aggregate the member outputs and thus, control how the ensemble computes its output. We show that the proposed GP approach evolves smaller more diverse ensembles compared to an established ensemble selection algorithm, while still performing as well as, or better than the established approach. The evolved GP ensembles also perform well compared to other bagging and boosting approaches, particularly on tasks with high levels of class imbalance.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2013.2293393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6677603","Classification;ensemble machine learning;genetic programming;unbalanced data","Accuracy;Bagging;Genetic algorithms;Silicon;Sociology;Statistics;Training","Pareto optimisation;approximation theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;trees (mathematics)","GP classifiers;Pareto-approximated front;bagging approach;boosting approach;composite solution trees;ensemble selection approach;genetic programming;learning;single composite genetic program solution;unbalanced data classification","","9","","56","","20131128","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Being data-driven, the method during training adapts to characteristics of the sensor setup, such as convolution effects in non-free-field situations, and to target signal specific acoustic properties. Experimental evaluation was conducted with algorithm training in anechoic single-talker scenarios and test data from several reverberant multi-talker situations, together with diffuse and real-recorded background noise, respectively. Results demonstrate that the method successfully generalizes from training to test conditions.

The estimation of edges with sub-pixel accuracy via a global B-spline depiction depends on determining the edge according to a Maximum Likelihood (ML) agenda and using the observed information likelihood. This practice guarantees that outliers present in data will be cleaned out. The data likelihood is calculated as a result of the observation model comprising both orientation and position data.

Proper sampling and feature selection contributes to reducing the size of the dataset while obtaining satisfactory results in model building. Theoretically, therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether a given dataset possesses a critical feature dimension, or the minimum number of features that is required for a given learning machine to achieve ""satisfactory"" performance. (Likewise, the critical sampling size problem concerns whether, for a given dataset, there is a minimum number of data points that must be included in any sample for a learning machine to achieve satisfactory performance.) Here the specific meaning of ""satisfactory"" performance is to be defined by the user. This paper addresses the complexity of both problems in one general theoretical setting and shows that they have the same complexity and are highly intractable. Next, an empirical method is applied in an attempt to find the approximate critical feature dimension of datasets. It is demonstrated that, under generally reasonable assumptions pertaining to feature ranking algorithms, the critical feature dimension are successfully discovered by the empirical method for a number of datasets of various sizes. The results are encouraging in achieving significant feature size reduction and point to a promising way in dealing with big data.

A trouble of surveillance camera in pedestrianly areas is that position of camera is too far or too close to the target objects and it compromises detection performance. In order to limit effects of camera positions, this paper proposes an event detection framework using grid-based features, which is a combination of localized information and event rules. Relationship between grid resolution and accuracy performance of event detection is studied. Grid-based features are tested on Neural Network and SVM classifiers. Experimental results show that grid-based features perform better than non-grid features. Performance of learning machines is also related to event types and grid size.

After development and delivery of these systems there is no simple mechanism for these clinicians to improve the system's classification while encountering any false classification by the system. So the improvement process of the system's classification after initial training (during development) can be termed as `dead'. We consider neurologist as the best available benchmark for system's learning. In this article, we propose an `alive' system, capable of improving its performance by taking clinician's feedback into consideration.

Thus, it would be highly advantageous if we can train the model using the data from other projects rather than the same project. In this paper, we have performed cross project predictions using 12 datasets obtained from three open source Apache projects, Abdera, POI and Rave. In the study, cross project predictions include both the inter-project (different projects) and inter-version (different versions of same projects) predictions. For cross project predictions, we investigated whether the characteristics of the datasets are valuable for selecting the training set for a known testing set. We concluded that cross project predictions give high accuracy and the distributional characteristics of the datasets are extremely useful for selecting the appropriate training set.

Progressive visual analytics depends on adapting analytical algorithms to produce meaningful partial results and enable analyst intervention without sacrificing computational speed. The paradigm also depends on adapting information visualization techniques to incorporate the constantly refining results without overwhelming analysts and provide interactions to support an analyst directing the analytic.

Both simulated and real EMG are used. Results are evaluated for each contaminant: 1) power line interference; 2) motion artifact; 3) ECG interference; 4) quantization noise; 5) analog-to-digital converter clipping; and 6) amplifier saturation, as a function of the level of signal contamination. Results show that different ranges of contamination can be detected in the EMG depending on the type of contaminant. At high levels of contamination, the SVM classifies all EMG signals as contaminated, whereas at low levels of contamination, it classifies the majority of EMG signals as contaminant free. A transition point for each contaminant is identified, where the classification accuracy drops and variance in classification increases. In some cases, contamination can be detected with the SVM when it is not visually discernible.

The distribution of detected microcalcifications depends on their intensity and window size. We propose an adaptive window and adaptive threshold (AWAT) method for microcalcification detection. Based on the intensity of the distribution, we found that 2 times of standard deviation (2SD) is the optimum threshold for detecting local maxima. We also propose an adaptive window that is dependent on the surrounding tissue. The local maxima are identified using a threshold adapted to each window. Then, small objects are removed using morphological operations. The remaining local maxima are called candidates and classified into microcalcification or normal tissue using three classifiers: a multilayer perceptron, a radial basis function neural network, and a support vector machine. We compared the results of our method to a method using five different fixed window sizes, evaluating the performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Our experimental results revealed that our method outperformed all the fixed window size approaches, for all the classifiers investigated. Overall, the multilayer perceptron performed the best among the classifiers, with area under ROC curve A<sub>z</sub>=0.951 (compared with A<sub>z</sub>=0.916 and A<sub>z</sub>=0.847). Finally, the results found that size of window varies from 10 and 131 pixels, while the threshold also varies from 5.628 and 229.959 of intensity. In the spatial domain, both threshold and window size are required to detect local maxima. The results of our experiments demonstrated that the proposed AWAT method performed better than fixed window size methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4963-2; POD:978-1-4799-4962-5","10.1109/ICSEC.2014.6978238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6978238","adaptive threshold;machine learning;microcalcification classification;microcalcification detection","Breast cancer;Breast tissue;Computer science;Feature extraction;Radial basis function networks;Standards;Support vector machines","cancer;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical image processing;multilayer perceptrons;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","2-times-of-standard deviation;2SD;AWAT method;ROC curve;adaptive window-and-adaptive threshold method;distribution intensity;image pixels;local maxima detection;local maxima identification;mammograms;microcalcification detection;microcalcification identification;morphological operations;multilayer perceptron classifier;normal tissue;optimum threshold;performance evaluation;radial basis function neural network classifier;receiver operating characteristic curve;spatial domain;support vector machine classifier","","0","","29","","","July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms.

Modern astronomy presents a variety of such phenomena in the form of transient events in digital synoptic sky surveys, including cosmic explosions (supernovae, gamma ray bursts), relativistic phenomena (black hole formation, jets), potentially hazardous asteroids, etc. We have been developing a set of machine learning tools to detect, classify and plan a response to transient events for astronomy applications, using the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) as a scientific and methodological testbed. The ability to respond rapidly to the potentially most interesting events is a key bottleneck that limits the scientific returns from the current and anticipated synoptic sky surveys. Similar challenge arise in other contexts, from environmental monitoring using sensor networks to autonomous spacecraft systems. Given the exponential growth of data rates, and the time-critical response, we need a fully automated and robust approach. We describe the results obtained to date, and the possible future developments.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4287-9; POD:978-1-4799-4286-2","10.1109/eScience.2014.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6972266","Bayesian methods;automated decision making;classification;machine learning;massive data streams;sky surveys","Astronomy;Cathode ray tubes;Extraterrestrial measurements;Pollution measurement;Real-time systems;Time measurement;Transient analysis","astronomical surveys;astronomy computing;data analysis;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CRTS;Catalina Real-time Transient Survey;astronomy applications;automated real-time classification;automated real-time decision making;black hole formation;cosmic explosions;data analysis;digital synoptic sky surveys;gamma ray bursts;jets;machine learning tools;massive data streams;potentially hazardous asteroids;relativistic phenomena;scientific data collection;supernovae;technological data collection","","1","","36","","","20-24 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current DSM technology can now provide automated off-site control of domestic and industrial devices. Many questions arise in regards to controlling a potentially large proportion of the population's electricity: To what level can we reduce demand? What incentives could retailers offer customers? How do we ensure consumers are satisfied? Previous trials of DSM control techniques have had various levels of success in reducing demand and in changing the consumption habits of individuals over time. The main criticism of existing automated control techniques is that they do not account for customer satisfaction and therefore do not survive in the long term. We propose a novel automated machine learning approach that incorporates customer satisfaction into automated demand reduction, satisfying both customers and retailers. Through a simulation of 200,000 households equipped with automated demand control, we conduct experiments measuring electricity levels alongside population satisfaction levels under different energy control policies. We illustrate that significant energy and cost savings can be achieved without compromising consumer satisfaction.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3251-1; POD:978-1-4799-3252-8","10.1109/AIMS.2013.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6959942","demand side management;machine learning;reinforcement learning;smart meters consumer satisfaction","Australia;Customer satisfaction;Electricity;Energy consumption;Generators;Home appliances;Optimization","demand side management;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing","DSM control techniques;DSM technology;customer satisfaction;energy consumption;energy control policy;intelligent energy demand side management;machine learning approach","","0","","11","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For each native language, the predicted scores of 15 error categories from SVM machine learning models are used as a vector representation of each sentence.

However, these systems struggle to provide comparable quality to that of locally stored and rendered 3D data. Since the rendered 3D content on to the client machine is controlled by the users, their interactions have a strong impact on the performance of 3D content streaming and rendering system. Thus, considering user behaviors in these systems could bring significant performance improvements. In this paper, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based predictor is proposed for 3D content streaming and rendering. The user interactions on various 3D contents are profiled and used as information to train the Neural Network predictors. The 3D content could be static or dynamic 3D object / scene. We test our model through another set of interactions over the 3D contents by same users. The tested result shows that our model can learn the user interactions and is able to predict several interactions to help in optimizing the streaming and rendering for better performance. We also propose various approaches based on traces collected from the same/different users to accelerate the learning process of the neural network.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4963-2; POD:978-1-4799-4962-5","10.1109/ICSEC.2014.6978239","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6978239","3D Streaming;Artificial Neural Network;Machine Learning;Predictive Model;Progressive Meshing;User Interactions Profiling","Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Training","neural nets;rendering (computer graphics);solid modelling","3D content streaming and rendering system;artificial neural network based predictor;client machine;dynamic 3D object;learning process;neural network based predictors;static 3D object","","0","","9","","","July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classiffication of seabed substrates traditionally requires manual analysis by a marine biologist, according to an established classiffication system. Accurate, consistent and robust classiffication is difficult in underwater video due to varying lighting conditions, turbidity and method of original recording. We have developed a system that uses ground truth data from marine biologists to train and test per-frame classiffiers. In this paper we present preliminary results of this using various feature representations (histograms, Gabor wavelets) and classiffiers (SVC, kNN) on both full-frame and patched-based analysis, achieving up to 93% accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6713-1; POD:978-1-4799-6714-8","10.1109/CVAUI.2014.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6961263","Gabor;machine learning;substrate classiffcation;texture;underwater video analysis","Biology;Histograms;Image color analysis;Lighting;Monitoring;Substrates;Training","image classification;video signal processing;wavelet transforms","Gabor wavelets;SVC;automated classification;feature representations;histograms;kNN;marine biologist;patched-based analysis;robust classiffication system;seabed substrates;underwater video","","0","","11","","","24-24 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the sampling rate depends upon the target's acceleration and heading and will therefore generally be time varying. When classifying radar tracks using temporal features, too low or highly varying sampling rates deteriorates the classifier's performance. In this work, we propose to model the temporal variations of the target's speed by low-order polynomial regression. Using the polynomial we obtain the conditional statistics of the targets speed at some future time given its speed at the current time. When used in a classifier based on Gaussian mixture models and with real radar data, it is shown that the inclusions of conditional statistics describing the targets temporal variations, leads to a substantial improvement in the overall classification performance.","2219-5491;22195491","Electronic:978-0-9928-6261-9; POD:978-1-4799-4603-7; USB:978-0-9928-6262-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6952502","Automatic target classification;Machine learning;Radar;Surveillance","Acceleration;Birds;Marine vehicles;Radar cross-sections;Radar tracking;Target tracking","Gaussian processes;mixture models;polynomials;radar tracking;regression analysis;signal classification;target tracking","Gaussian mixture model;conditional statistics;moving target acceleration;polynomial regression;radar track classification;sampling rate;target heading;temporal variation modelling","","0","","9","","","1-5 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the method that does not access the data with long Hamming radius by using multiple binary codes.

Our approach divides the inputs into subsets and then searches for the best machine learning technique for transforming each subset of inputs. Preprocessing of the inputs is not required in our approach because the machine learning techniques appropriately transform the inputs. Hence, this technique is capable of learning where nonlinear transformations of the inputs are needed. We show that the learned data transformations correspond to energy forecasting domain knowledge. Transformed subsets of the inputs are combined using ensemble regression, and the final forecasted value is obtained. Our approach is tested with natural gas and electricity demand signals.
