This study employs strengths and weaknesses of solutions for finding the best solution of any problem in genetic programming. The strengths and weaknesses are used to assist in finding the right partners (solutions) during crossover operation. The probability of crossover between two solutions is evaluated using relative strengths and weaknesses as well as overall strengths of solutions (Improved Comparative Partner Selection (ICPS)). The solutions qualifying for crossover through ICPS criteria are supposed to produce better solutions and are allowed to produce more children through brood recombination. The brood recombination helps to exploit the search space close to the optimum solution more efficiently. The proposed method is applied on different benchmarking problems and results demonstrate that the method is highly efficient in exploring the search space.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-1180-6; POD:978-1-4799-1179-0; USB:978-1-4799-1178-3","10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661901","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661901","Brood recombination;Diversity in genetic programming;Improved comparative partner selection","Educational institutions;Genetic programming;Iterative closest point algorithm;Multiplexing;Sociology;Statistics;Training","genetic algorithms;probability;search problems","ICPS criteria;benchmarking problems;brood recombination;crossover probability;evolutionary methods;genetic programming;improved comparative partner selection;optimum solution;search space","","0","","16","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then use this example to guide source separation and, for that purpose, we introduce a new variant of the nonnegative matrix partial co-factorization (NMPCF) model based on a so called excitation-filter-channel speech model.

Following this strategy, a new ADL algorithm using K-plane clustering is proposed in this paper, which is based on the observation that, the observed data are co-planer in the analysis sparse model. In other words, the columns of the observed data form multi-dimensional subspaces (hyperplanes), and the rows of the analysis dictionary are the normal vectors of the hyper-planes. The normal directions of the K-dimensional concentration hyper-planes can be estimated using the K-plane clustering algorithm, and then the rows of the analysis dictionary which are the normal vectors of the hyper-planes can be obtained.

Instead of selecting the best clustering from the results by using clustering selection criterion in original SMART framework, we introduce a successive processing strategy into the framework to subtract clusters one by one in iterations. In doing so, the silhouette index is employed to evaluate the intermediate clusters and order them according to their index values from high to low. Then we subtract the best cluster from the original dataset and iterate the remaining dataset back to the splitting-while-merging (SWM) process to start a new iteration. The clustering and subtracting are repeated successively and terminated automatically, once no splitting happened in the SWM process. Consequently, all clusters can be obtained by iterations. We implement the framework using component-wise expectation maximization (CEM) for finite mixture models (FMM). The E-SMART-FMM implementation is tested in real NCI-60 cancer dataset.

That algorithm has two shortcomings: One is an assumption that the spatial sparsity level of the sources at each time-instant is constant and known; The second is the algorithm's sensitivity to the possible presence of temporal “blocks” of the signals with identical support. In this work we propose two pre-processing stages for improving the applicability and the performance of the algorithm. A first stage is aimed at identifying “blocks” of similar support, and pruning the data accordingly for the support-recovery stage. A second stage is aimed at recovering the sparsity level at each time-instant by exploiting observed structural inter-relations between the signals at different time-instants.

From a computational perspective, we have established a sufficient condition for the “inclusion property” among successive working sets, which allows us to save computation time. Most importantly, under the inclusion property, the monotonic reduction of the energy function can be assured in both substeps at each iteration, thus assuring the convergence of the algorithm. Moreover, ridge regularization is incorporated to improve the robustness and better cope with over-fitting and ill-conditioned problems. To verify the proposed algorithm, we conducted simulations on three data sets from the UCI database: adult, shuttle and bank. Our simulation shows stability and convergence of the RiSVO method.

A novel method for efficiently capturing drifts in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is presented that leads to enhanced fMRI activation detection. The proposed algorithm apply a first order differencing to the fMRI time series samples in order to remove the drift effect. Using linear least-squares, a consistent hemodynamic response function (HRF) of the fMRI voxel is estimated as a first-step that leads to an optimal estimate of the drift based on a wavelet thresholding technique. The de-drifted fMRI voxel response is then obtained by removing the estimated drift from the fMRI time-series. Its performance is assessed using a visual task real fMRI data set.

The results of applying the method to synthetic and real EEG data show that the supervised SSA can separate the single channel signal components automatically.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-1180-6; POD:978-1-4799-1179-0; USB:978-1-4799-1178-3","10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661895","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661895","EEG;EMD;SSA;supervised source separation","Convergence;Covariance matrices;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Electroencephalography;Indexes;Source separation;Time series analysis","electroencephalography;medical signal processing;source separation","EEG signals;EMD;SSA;electroencephalograms data;empirical mode decomposition;single channel signal components;singular spectrum analysis subspace technique;supervised single channel source separation","","1","","9","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also extend the MR8 filter bank used in [1] to 3D in order to match the dimensionality of FDG-PET images, while maintaining important properties such as invariance to rotation and a low dimensionality of the filter response space. We propose two methods to tackle difficulties inherent to the extraction and classification of texture from images whose appearance varies over space and to the fact that most regions of the image are not affected by AD or MCI. The first method selects only the voxels with the most discriminative filter responses, while the second method focuses on brain regions manually labeled by an expert physician. Experiments showed that the proposed approaches outperformed the more common one that uses voxel intensities directly as features both in the diagnosis of AD and MCI.

The proposed separating system only receives observed quantum states, each obtained after two quantum bits (qubits) were first independently initialized with values that this system does not know and then coupled according to a quantum operator involving parameter values that the separating system does not know a priori. This system aims at restoring the information contained in the initial qubit states. We previously tackled this problem by first converting the observed quantum state into data which have a classical (i.e. non-quantum) form and then only processing the latter data with classical means. We here propose a new approach, based on a separating system which uses quantum processing means (consisting of a specific unitary operator) in its feedforward path. Classical processing is only used in the feedback path of this system, to adapt its transfer function. The proposed adaptation method is based on binary-valued monodirectional output measurements and related to quantum disentanglement. We also analyze its relationships with classical Independent Component Analysis. We prove that this BQSS method partly restores the initial two-qubit states: it determines their components up to some phase and permutation indeterminacies.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-1180-6; POD:978-1-4799-1179-0; USB:978-1-4799-1178-3","10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661954","Blind quantum source separation;adaptive quantum information processing;independent component analysis;machine learning;quantum bit (qubit);quantum-processing separating system;qubit uncoupling","Abstracts;Couplings;Feedforward neural networks;Indexes;Source separation;Transfer functions;Vectors","blind source separation;independent component analysis;quantum computing","BQSS;BQSS method;ICA;binary-valued monodirectional output measurements;blind quantum source separation;blind qubit uncoupling capability;classical-feedback separating structure;independent component analysis;monodirectional measurements;parameter values;permutation indeterminacy;phase indeterminacy;quantum bits;quantum disentanglement;quantum operator;quantum processing;quantum-feedforward separating structure;transfer function;unitary operator","","3","","7","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multi-scale mixture models we assume have a hierarchical structure in which each component of the mixture is represented by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In speaker modeling from speech, this GMM represents intra-speaker dynamics derived from the difference in the attributes such as phoneme contexts and the existence of non-stationary noise and the mixture of GMMs (MoGMMs) represents inter-speaker dynamics derived from the difference in speakers. Gibbs sampling is a powerful technique to estimate such hierarchically structured models but can easily induce the local optima problem depending on its use especially when the elemental GMMs are complex in structure. To solve this problem, a highly accurate and robust sampling method based on the blocked Gibbs sampling and iterative conditional modes (ICM) is proposed and effectively applied for reducing a singularity solution given in the model with complex multi-modal distributions. In speaker clustering experiments under non-stationary noise, the proposed sampling-based model estimation improved the clustering performance by 17% on average compared to the conventional sampling-based methods.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-1180-6; POD:978-1-4799-1179-0; USB:978-1-4799-1178-3","10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661902","Fully Bayesian approach;blocked Gibbs sampling;iterative conditional modes;multi-scale mixture model;speaker clustering","Bayes methods;Data models;Estimation;Noise;Sampling methods;Speech;Vectors","Gaussian noise;estimation theory;iterative methods;pattern clustering;signal sampling;speaker recognition","Gaussian mixture model;ICM;MoGMM;blocked Gibbs sampling;clustering performance;continuous multiscale mixture;hierarchical structure;inter-speaker dynamics;intra-speaker dynamics;iterative conditional modes;local optima problem;multimodal distributions;multiscale mixture models;noisy data;nonstationary noise;phoneme contexts;robust sampling method;sampling-based model estimation;singularity solution;speaker clustering experiments;speaker modeling","","0","","16","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The similarity measurement is then used for recognising known trajectories and identifying unknown trajectories as would be required for identifying “abnormal” vital-sign time-series. We test our approach using a dataset that contains vital-sign observational data collected from a cohort of 154 patients who are recovering from gastrointestinal surgery.

This paper proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on wavelets and local binary patterns (LBPs). The proposed method decomposes a face image into multiple sub-bands of frequencies using wavelet transform. Each sub-band in the wavelet domain is divided into non-overlapping sub-regions. Then LBP histograms based on the traditional 8-neighbour sampling points are extracted from the approximation sub-band, whilst 4-neighbour sampling points are used to extract LBPHs from detail sub-bands. Finally, all LBPHs are concatenated into a single feature histogram to effectively represent the face image. Euclidean distance is used to measure the similarity of different feature histograms and the final recognition is performed by the nearest-neighbour classifier. The above strategy was tested on two publicly available face databases (Yale and ORL) using different scenarios and different combination of sub-bands.

This paper studies novelty detection in a new setting where the data object is represented as a bag of instances and associated with multiple class labels, referred to as multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning. Contrary to the common assumption in MIML that each instance in a bag belongs to one of the known classes, in novelty detection, we focus on the scenario where bags may contain novel-class instances. The goal is to determine, for any given instance in a new bag, whether it belongs to a known class or a novel class. Detecting novelty in the MIML setting captures many real-world phenomena and has many potential applications. For example, in a collection of tagged images, the tag may only cover a subset of objects existing in the images. Discovering an object whose class has not been previously tagged can be useful for the purpose of soliciting a label for the new object class. To address this novel problem, we present a discriminative framework for detecting new class instances. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and reveal that the presence of unlabeled novel instances in training bags is helpful to the detection of such instances in testing stage.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-1180-6; POD:978-1-4799-1179-0; USB:978-1-4799-1178-3","10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661985","Novelty detection;kernel method;multi-instance multilabel","Birds;Kernel;Linear programming;Signal processing;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);signal detection","MIML setting;data object;detecting novelty;machine learning;multi-instance multilabel learning;multilabel multi-instance framework;multiple class labels;novelty detection;potential applications;signal processing;training bags","","1","","15","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our second approach, we assume that some components of the factorization are known and we use them to inform our NMF algorithm. We thus consider a specific parameterization which involves these constraints.

The used document inventory, which is not publicly available, was provided to us by the European Union (EU) in the framework of an EU project, the aim of which was to analyse, classify, and visualise EU funded research in social sciences and humanities in EU framework programmes FP5 and FP6. This project, called the SSH project for short, was aimed at the evaluation of the contributions of research to the development of EU policies. For the semantic based grouping, we start from a Multi-Dimensional Scaling analysis of the document vectors, which is the result of a prior semantic analysis. As an alternative to a semantic analysis, we searched for inter-document references or direct references. Direct references are defined as terms that explicitly refer to other documents present in the inventory. We show that the grouping based on references is largely similar to the one based on semantics, but with considerably less computational efforts. In addition, the non-expert can make better use of the results, since the references are displayed as graphical webpages with hyperlinks pointing to both the referenced and the referencing document(s), and the reason of linkage. Finally, we show that the combination of a database, to store the data and the (intermediate) results, and a webserver, to visualise the results, offers a powerful platform to analyse the document inventory and to share the results with all participants/collaborators involved in a data- and computation intensive EU-project, thereby guaranteeing both data- and result-consistency.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-1180-6; POD:978-1-4799-1179-0; USB:978-1-4799-1178-3","10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661952","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661952","HPC;Semantic Analysis;Text Mining;client-server infrastructure","Databases;Europe;Semantics;Servers;Terminology;Text analysis;Vectors","data visualisation;database management systems;document handling;file servers;pattern clustering","EU funded research;EU project;European Union;FP5;FP6;Webserver;data-consistency;database;document clustering;document inventories;document vectors;full text semantic analysis;graphical webpages;humanities;hyperlinks;interdocument reference detection;multidimensional scaling analysis;result-consistency;semantic based grouping;social sciences","","0","","10","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A structural equation model called Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM) has been extensively studied to uniquely estimate causal structures in data. The key assumptions are that external influences are independent and follow non-Gaussian distributions. However, LiNGAM does not capture temporal structural changes in observed data. In this paper, we consider learning causal structures in longitudinal data that collects samples over a period of time. In previous studies of LiNGAM, there was no model specialized to handle longitudinal data with multiple samples. Therefore, we propose a new model called longitudinal LiNGAM and a new estimation method using the information on temporal structural changes and non-Gaussianity of data.

These phonemes are hard to classify, due to their weak energy and lack of periodicity. Sound textures such as sound made by a flowing stream of water or falling droplets of rain have similar aperiodic properties in temporal domain as unvoiced phonemes. These sounds are easily differentiated by a human ear. Recent studies on sound texture analysis and synthesis have shown that the human auditory system perceives sound textures using simple statistics. These statistics are obtained by decomposing sounds using a set of filter-banks and computing the moments of the filter responses, along with their correlation values. In this work we investigate if the above mentioned statistics, which are easy to extract, can also be used as features for classifying unvoiced sounds. To incorporate the moments and correlation values as features, a framework containing multiple classifiers is proposed.

Thus our model is particularly effective for modelling high-dimensional time-series with limited number of instances in the minority positive class. We conduct extensive classification experiments based on several well-known time-series datasets (both single-and multi-modal) by first randomly generating synthetic instances from our learned mixture model to correct the imbalance. We then compare our results to several state-of-the-art oversampling techniques and the results demonstrate that when our proposed model is used, the same support vector machines classifier achieves much better classification accuracy across the range of datasets. In fact, the proposed method achieves the best average performance 27 times out of 30 multi-modal datasets according to the F-value metric.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-1180-6; POD:978-1-4799-1179-0; USB:978-1-4799-1178-3","10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661937","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661937","Gaussian graphical models;Imbalanced dataset;Mixture models;Multi-modality;Oversampling;Time-series","Computational modeling;Covariance matrices;Data models;Graphical models;Markov processes;Random variables;Vectors","Gaussian processes;covariance analysis;pattern classification;sampling methods;support vector machines;time series;trees (mathematics)","F-value metric;MOGT;classification accuracy;close-by time points;high-dimensional time-series;imbalanced time-series binary classification;learned mixture model;minority positive class;mixture-of-Gaussian trees model;multimodal minority class;oversampling techniques;parsimonious statistical model;randomly generating synthetic instances;support vector machines classifier","","0","","31","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In datasets, there are n spatial maps that contain p voxels. The number of voxels is very high compared to the number of analyzed spatial maps. Clustering of the spatial maps is usually based on correlation matrices. This usually works well, although such a similarity matrix inherently can explain only a certain amount of the total variance contained in the high-dimensional data where n is relatively small but p is large. For high-dimensional space, it is reasonable to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering. In this research, we used the recently developed diffusion map for dimensionality reduction in conjunction with spectral clustering.

The model selection by the new Bayesian error estimator is experimentally shown to improve the classification accuracy in small sample-size situations, and is able to avoid the excess variability inherent to traditional cross validation approaches.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-1180-6; POD:978-1-4799-1179-0; USB:978-1-4799-1178-3","10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661987","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661987","Bayesian MMSE estimator;Linear classifiers;Logistic regression;Regularization","Bayes methods;Cancer;Computational modeling;Correlation;Data models;Logistics;Training","Bayes methods;error analysis;pattern classification;regression analysis","ℓ<sub>1</sub> penalty;Bayesian error estimation;Bayesian model selection;classification tool;cross validation approaches;feature selection;high dimensional problems;regularization parameter;regularized logistic regression models;small sample-size situations;sparse logistic regression","","4","","22","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We observe that it is possible to classify tasks of varying difficulty based on EEG signals. Additionally, we also present a correlation analysis between intention levels detected from EEG and surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals. Our experimental results suggest that it is possible to extract the intention level information from EEG signals in response to task difficulty and indicate some level of correlation between EEG and EMG.

Essentially, the prediction of optimal process conditions in large fermentations based on small scale experiments is non-trivial. For example, common statistical methods encounter problems with the high-dimensional, small sample size and, on the other hand, the use of various scale-up criteria requires a priori knowledge that may be difficult to obtain. We propose a novel computational scale-up approach applicable to various bioprocesses. The method bases on regularized linear and logistic regression. With embedded feature selection, it automatically identifies the most influential parameters and predicts their values in large scale. In addition, the method predicts the resulting large scale yield. As a case study, we examined the production of a cytotoxic compound. We predicted scale-up from flask and 2L to 30L fermentations and found that, in both cases, the product yield predictions are close to experimentally observed yields.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-1180-6; POD:978-1-4799-1179-0; USB:978-1-4799-1178-3","10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661906","Bioprocesses modeling;regression model;regularized logistic regression;scale-up;yield prediction","Biological system modeling;Data models;Encoding;Logistics;Numerical models;Predictive models;Testing","biotechnology;fermentation;microorganisms;regression analysis","bioprocess scale-up methodology;cytotoxic compound production;feature selection;fermentation;flask cultivations;logistic regression;process conditions;regularized linear regression;statistical methods","","0","","17","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They respond quickly to environmental changes and can be used to infer about other organisms (e.g., insects they feed on). Traditional methods for collecting data about birds involves costly human effort. A promising alternative is acoustic monitoring. There are many advantages to recording audio of birds compared to human surveys, including increased temporal and spatial resolution and extent, applicability in remote sites, reduced observer bias, and potentially lower cost. However, it is an open problem for signal processing and machine learning to reliably identify bird sounds in real-world audio data collected in an acoustic monitoring scenario. Some of the major challenges include multiple simultaneously vocalizing birds, other sources of non-bird sound (e.g., buzzing insects), and background noise like wind, rain, and motor vehicles.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-1180-6; POD:978-1-4799-1179-0; USB:978-1-4799-1178-3","10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661934","","Birds;Histograms;Image segmentation;Noise;Rain;Spectrogram;Vectors","acoustic signal processing;audio recording;audio signal processing;ecology;learning (artificial intelligence);signal resolution;zoology","MLSP competition;acoustic classification;acoustic monitoring scenario;audio recording;background noise;biological indicators;bird sounds;ecological research;human effort;human surveys;machine learning;multiple simultaneous bird species;noisy environment;nonbird sound;real-world audio data;reduced observer bias;remote sites;signal processing;spatial resolution;temporal resolution","","8","","23","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here we propose a new method, named as the unification of clustering results from multiple datasets using external specifications (UNCLES). The external specifications imposed in this study aim at mining for the subsets of genes that are consistently co-expressed in one set of datasets (S<sup>+</sup>) and not consistently co-expressed in another set of datasets (S<sup>-</sup>). We tested our proposed method over eight budding yeast cell-cycle datasets for S<sup>+</sup> and other six general budding yeast datasets for S<sup>-</sup>.
