In this paper, we propose the notion of Asymmetric Support Vector Machine (ASVM), an asymmetric extension of the SVM, for these applications. Different from the existing SVM extensions such as thresholding and parameter tuning, ASVM employs a new objective that models the imbalance between the costs of false predictions from different classes in a novel way such that user tolerance on false-positive rate can be explicitly specified. Such a new objective formulation allows us of obtaining a lower false-positive rate without much degradation of the prediction accuracy or increase in training time. Furthermore, we show that the generalization ability is preserved with the new objective. We also study the effects of the parameters in ASVM objective and address some implementation issues related to the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) to cope with large-scale data. An extensive simulation is conducted and shows that ASVM is able to yield either noticeable improvement in performance or reduction in training time as compared to the previous arts.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2012.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165285","Support Vector Machine;classification;low false-positive learning","Accuracy;Cancer;Postal services;Support vector machines;Testing;Training;Tuning","","","","4","","41","","20120306","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence, it is attractive to estimate the underlying model structure of LPV systems based on measured data, i.e., to learn the underlying dependencies of the model coefficients together with model orders etc. In this paper a Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) approach is introduced which is capable of reconstructing the dependency structure for linear regression based LPV models even in case of rational dynamic dependency.

First, a knowledge-based fuzzy clustering algorithm is performed to segment the brain tissues into six classes including white matter (WM), grey matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), T2-hyperintense regions, necrosis and enhanced tumor.

However, major drawbacks of the LANDMARC approach are that its localization accuracy largely depends on the density of reference tags and the high cost of RFID readers. In order to overcome these drawbacks, two localization algorithms, namely weighted path loss (WPL) and extreme learning machine (ELM), are proposed in this paper.

This novel approach to decoding offers unique advantages for BMI control applications. Compared to supervised learning decoding methods, the actor-critic RL algorithm does not require an explicit set of training data to create a static control model, but rather it incrementally adapts the model parameters according to its current performance, in this case requiring only a very basic feedback signal. We show how this algorithm achieved high performance when mapping the monkey's neural states (94%) to robot actions, and only needed to experience a few trials before obtaining accurate real-time control of the robot arm.

Specifically, liver segmentation is formalized as a pattern recognition problem, where a given voxel is to be assigned a correct label - either in a liver or a non-liver class. Each voxel is associated with a feature vector that describes image textures. Based on the generated features, an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier is employed to perform the voxel classification. Since preliminary voxel segmentation tends to be less accurate at the boundary, and there are other non-liver tissue voxels with similar texture characteristics as liver parenchyma, morphological smoothing and 3D level set refinement are applied to enhance the accuracy of segmentation. Our approach is validated on a set of CT data. The experiment shows that the proposed approach with ELM has the reasonably good performance for liver parenchyma segmentation. It demonstrates a comparable result in accuracy of classification but with a much faster training and classification speed compared with support vector machine (SVM).","1094-687X;1094687X","Electronic:978-1-4577-1787-1; POD:978-1-4244-4119-8; USB:978-1-4244-4120-4","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346783","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346783","","Computed tomography;Image segmentation;Level set;Liver;Shape;Support vector machines;Training","computerised tomography;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;support vector machines","3D computerised tomography images;3D level set refinement;SVM;extreme learning machine classifier;feature vector;image textures;liver parenchyma segmentation;morphological smoothing;nonliver tissue voxels;pattern recognition problem;semiautomatic approach;support vector machine","Artificial Intelligence;Automation;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Liver;Support Vector Machines;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","1","","15","","","Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such virtualized environments, both virtual machines (VMs) and hosted applications need to be configured on-the-fly to adapt to system dynamics. The interplay between the layers of VMs and applications further complicates the problem of cloud configuration. Independent tuning of each aspect may not lead to optimal system wide performance. In this paper, we propose a framework, namely CoTuner, for coordinated configuration of VMs and resident applications. At the heart of the framework is a model-free hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) approach, which combines the advantages of Simplex method and RL method and is further enhanced by the use of system knowledge guided exploration policies. Experimental results on Xen-based virtualized environments with TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks demonstrate that CoTuner is able to drive a virtual server cluster into an optimal or near-optimal configuration state on the fly, in response to the change of workload. It improves the systems throughput by more than 30 percent over independent tuning strategies. In comparison with the coordinated tuning strategies based on basic RL or Simplex algorithm, the hybrid RL algorithm gains 25 to 40 percent throughput improvement.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6216363","Cloud computing;autonomic configuration;reinforcement learning","Clustering algorithms;Learning;Resource management;Servers;System performance;Throughput;Tuning","cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);real-time systems;resource allocation;virtual machines;virtualisation","CoTuner framework;RL method;Simplex method;TPC-C benchmarks;TPC-W benchmarks;VM;Xen-based virtualized environments;cloud computing;cloud configuration;coordinated self-configuration;coordinated tuning strategies;model-free hybrid RL approach;model-free hybrid reinforcement learning;near-optimal configuration state;real-time resource configuration;system dynamics;system knowledge;system throughput improvement;virtual machines;virtual server cluster","","8","","28","","20120612","April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Based on the ensemble learning strategy, this paper develops an ensemble model of a promising novel learning technology called extreme learning machine (ELM) for high-quality STLF of Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The model consists of a series of single ELMs. During the training, the ensemble model generalizes the randomness of single ELMs by selecting not only random input parameters but also random hidden nodes within a pre-defined range. The forecast result is taken as the median value the single ELM outputs. Owing to the very fast training/tuning speed of ELM, the model can be efficiently updated to on-line track the variation trend of the electricity load and maintain the accuracy. The developed model is tested with the NEM historical load data and its performance is compared with some state-of-the-art learning algorithms.

First, we demonstrate that VR could be a useful platform to demonstrate and visualize machine intelligence research through the simulated 3D environment. Second, the integration of VR into machine intelligence research can provide a powerful platform to simulate, validate and facilitate the real-time interaction between the intelligent system and an unstructured environment. We discuss the detailed design strategy of the VR platform, and also demonstrated the interactive system performance based on the triple link inverted pendulum benchmark.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-2143-4; POD:978-1-4577-2144-1","10.1109/ICICIP.2012.6391478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6391478","","Control systems;Interactive systems;Machine intelligence;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Virtual environments","artificial intelligence;dynamic programming;human computer interaction;virtual reality","ADP;VR;adaptive dynamic programming;brain-like intelligent systems design;human-computer interface;machine intelligence;three-dimensional active virtual environment;triple link inverted pendulum;virtual reality interactive platform","","5","","15","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Attributes provide an intermediate feature representation in between low-level features and the class categories, and offer several attractive properties, among which are improved learning of novel categories based on few examples, as well as allowing for zero-shot learning. However, the major caveat is that learning semantic attributes is a laborious task, requiring a significant amount of time and human intervention to provide labels. In order to address this issue, we propose a weakly supervised approach to learn mid-level features, where the only supervision is provided by the category classes of the training examples. We develop a novel extension of the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) with Beta-Bernoulli process priors. Unlike the standard RBM, our model uses the class labels to promote more efficient sharing of information by different categories. This tends to improve the generalization performance. By using semantic attributes for which annotations are available, we show that we can find correspondences between the mid-level features that we learn and the labeled attributes. Therefore, the mid-level features have distinct semantic characterization which is very similar to that given by the semantic attributes, even though their labeling was not used during the training process. Our experimental results in object recognition tasks show significant performance gains, outperforming methods which rely on manually labeled semantic attributes.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-0-7695-4989-7; POD:978-1-4673-6410-2","10.1109/CVPR.2013.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6618912","Beta-Bernoulli process;Restricted Boltzmann Machine;attributes;mid-level features;semantics","Equations;Object recognition;Probability distribution;Semantics;Standards;Training;Vectors","Boltzmann machines;computer vision;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition","beta-Bernoulli process;category-dependent sharing;class-level supervision;computer vision problems;mid-level features;object recognition;restricted Boltzmann machines;semantic attributes;weakly supervised learning","","8","","30","","","23-28 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several kinds of parasitic torque ripples are periodic functions of the rotor position. To reduce them, a method called Iterative Learning Control (ILC) seems well suited, but is efficient for only one constant speed chosen by the designer (and all the integer multiples of this speed). To design a solution for a varying speed, an ILC variant named angle-based ILC is proposed, which no longer uses time as the reference, but the angular position.

Under three different prediction horizons, 10, 20, and 30 min, these two methods are compared systematically in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), sensitivity, and specificity. In addtion, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as a function of sensitivity and specificity is applied to evaluate the performace of ELM and RELM. The area under curve (AUC) value was used the evaluate the ROC performance for different test accurately. The experiment results demonstrate that these two methods can predict hypoglycemia pretty good. As expect, the bigger prediction horizon (PH), induce the worse performance. As hypoglycemia threshold is increased, sensitivity impoves at cost of spcificity. Both methods can get good specificity and acceptable sensitivity. Good specificity can make sure each alarm is effective for patients to take correct actions.

Instantaneous value of current signal is measured from the relaying end of the transmission line for one cycle duration from the inception of fault. Discrete wavelet transform is used to decompose the signal and extract certain features from it. The feature set is then normalized and best features are selected from the total feature set by forward feature selection method. Selected features are then fed as an input to the extreme learning machine for fault classification. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technique, it is tested on a 400 kV, 300 km series compensated transmission line for all the ten type of fault using MATLAB/ SIMULINK. A wide range of simulation condition is taken to generate the train and test pattern.

With ELM, the input weights and hidden biases are chosen randomly and the output weights are analytically determined using the inverse operation of the hidden layer output matrices. Due to this randomness of the input weights, ELM generally tends to require a higher number of hidden nodes to achieve a good generalization performance. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to train MLPs which combines the advantages of a powerful artificial immune system, called GAIS, with the advantages of ELM, eliminating the individual limitations of both when applied in isolation to the same task. In this proposal, the GAIS algorithm is responsible for finding a proper set of input weights whereas the output weights are determined by the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse. The proposed methodology was evaluated in seven well-known classification problems and its performance compares favorably with that produced by contenders, such as ELM, E-ELM and opt-aiNet.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1415-9; POD:978-1-4799-1413-5","10.1109/NaBIC.2013.6617854","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617854","Artificial Immune System;Classification;Extreme Learning Machine;Gaussian Network","Iris;Sonar","Gaussian processes;artificial immune systems;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;multilayer perceptrons","E-ELM;GAlS algorithm;Gaussian artificial immune system;Moore-Penrose generalized inverse;classification problems;extreme learning machine;generalization performance;hidden biases;hidden layer output matrices;hybrid MLP training approach;input weights;inverse operation;multilayer perceptrons;opt-aiNet;output weights;single-layer feedforward neural networks","","0","","25","","","12-14 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ELM has reputation as eager classifier with fast training and testing time but the classification result originally has still low testing accuracy even by increasing the hidden nodes number and adding more training data. To achieve better accuracy, we pursue a feature selection method to reduce the dimension of pose cluster training data in time sequence. We propose to use frequency of pose occurrence.

Furthermore, using only single feature to design the fusion rule is also commonly adopted. However, utilizing single feature to measure the quality of one image is not comprehensive. As a result, the detail losing and contrast reduction are caused by these rules. In the paper, In order to use multiple features extracted from one image simultaneously to obtain an adaptive weight value for the image, we propose an exposure fusion method called (ELM_EF). It is based on a regression method called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Firstly, we construct input vector for ELM using contrast, saturation and exposedness features from the chosen representative blocks. The label of input is obtained by using a Gaussian function with exposure setting of the image served as a parameter. Thus, training model can be got. Secondly, the statistic values of these features about each tested image are calculated, it is used for deciding the weight value of corresponding image with the training model. Experiments show that the proposed method can preserve more details and contrast than the sum weighted average method.

However, an important problem for PMSMs is that parasitic torques may degrade the performances of the drive system. These torque ripples generally vary periodically with the rotor position and lead to speed ripple. To suppress these speed ripples, an iterative learning control (ILC) is used, because it is a good candidate for dealing with periodical errors. In this paper, an original approach called “lying sensor technique” is proposed and analyzed. Compared to the torque ripple reduction approaches which realize the current compensation calculation in the controller, this technique consists in modifying the feedback speed information of the sensor. ILC is integrated into this technique for computing the lying speed information. Simulation is used to check the effectiveness of this approach.

By observing the root mean square and the correlation values of the IMFs during iterations, the first IMF is determined to be the undesired signal which could not be reduced by learning process. Furthermore, the command containing the first IMF could further excite the machine tool due to the resonance effects and cause the amplification of the error signal.

The CMI converts Purkinje cell simple spike firing rate into pulse-width modulation signals that drive a single joint robot arm. The CMI has no adaptive capability, thus any change observed in robot arm motion can be attributed directly to Purkinje cell firing activity. We employed a vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) adaptation paradigm in goldfish as the test for motor learning. Changes in eye muscle characteristics, or equivalently adding visual motion stimulus during head rotation require oculomotor commands to be calibrated by minimizing image slip across the retina, which acts as a control error signal. This calibration, known as VOR motor learning, has been postulated to depend on synaptic plasticity in the vestibulo-cerebellum, where Purkinje cells are believed to encode motor commands for eye movement. If this is true, then vestibulo-cerebellar Purkinje cells may similarly learn to correct error in a motor command signal when the oculomotor system is replaced with a different system, such as a robot arm. Desired motion and control error signal of the robot arm were presented as head rotation and retinal slip, respectively, to the fish VOR model. The control error of the robot arm was shown to decrease gradually, but not monotonically, and in many cases only in one direction. This evidence is the first direct demonstration that activity of a single Purkinje cell is capable of implementing adaptive motor control. The results also suggest that a single Purkinje cell can be responsible, at least in part, for directional selective VOR motor learning previously reported in goldfish [6] and monkeys [3].","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2743-5; POD:978-1-4673-2742-8","10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6505405","Brain Machine Interface;Purkinje cell;eye movement;goldfish;vestibular","","adaptive control;brain-computer interfaces;manipulators;pulse width modulation","VOR motor learning;adaptive motor control;cerebellar Purkinje cell firing activity;cerebellar roles;cerebellum machine interface;control error signal;eye muscle characteristics;fish VOR model;goldfish;head rotation;image slip;monkeys;motor command signal;oculomotor commands;oculomotor system;pulse width modulation signal;retinal slip;single joint robot arm motion;spike firing rate;synaptic plasticity;vestibulo cerebellar Purkinje cells;vestibulo cerebellum;vestibuloocular reflex adaptation paradigm;visual motion stimulus","","0","","6","","","20-24 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, an adaptive extreme learning machine (AELM) is proposed to update the initial classifier from the calibration session by using chunks of EEG data from the evaluation session whereby the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is used to extract the most discriminative features. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is on motor imagery data collected from 12 healthy subjects during a calibration session and an evaluation session on a separate day. The results from the proposed AELM were compared with non-adaptive ELM and SVM classifiers. The results showed that AELM was significantly better (p=0.03). Moreover, the results also showed that accumulating the evaluation session data and useing them for adapting the classifier will significantly improve the performance (p=0.001).

Experimental results on the Corel dataset and the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset show that our approach performs better on image matching, retrieval, and classification than using conventional visual features. To build our similarity measure, we need one-versus-all classifiers that are accurate and can be trained quickly on very large quantities of data. We adopt an SVM classifier with a histogram intersection kernel. We describe a novel fast training algorithm for this classifier: the Stochastic Intersection Kernel MAchine (SIKMA) training algorithm.

The other advantage of the proposed method is its fast speed which is due to ELM as the learning process of ELM is very fast.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6217-7; POD:978-1-4799-1664-1","10.1109/ICACCI.2013.6637480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637480","Calibration;ELM;JPEG images;Markov Random Process;Multi-class Steganalysis","Arrays;Discrete cosine transforms;Feature extraction;Markov processes;Neurons;Training;Transform coding","Markov processes;data compression;feature extraction;image classification;image coding;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);steganography","Markov random process;calibrated Markov features;colored JPEG image;embedding steganography technique;extreme learning machine;feature set;image JPEG coefficient correlation;image classification;image cropping;image decompression;image recompression;learning process;multiclass JPEG steganalysis;multiclass steganalysis method","","3","","24","","","22-25 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The original independent assumption on missing detection will be invalid for the tracking problems encountered via fluorescent techniques because of the 'photobleaching' phenomenon. We designed a statistical model based on the log likelihood with the stochastic modeling of photo bleaching to tackle the problem. Our model can correctly distinguish the missing from death and is capable to trace between the missing object and its recovery, even for a long period of missing detection. Besides, modifications to existing optimization problems are discussed and an efficient and novel algorithm to search the global optimal is proposed. Additionally, we introduce the EM algorithm with Monte Carlo approximation to realize the automatical learning of the parameters of the model. Several experiments are presented in the simulation part to show the model's high accuracy in dealing with sophisticated scenes and thus demonstrate its merit in facing of the new challenge.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4706-0; POD:978-1-4577-1987-5","10.1109/iCBEB.2012.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6245212","algorithm;fluorescence;learning;motion correspondence;multiple targets tracking;photobleaching","Approximation algorithms;Educational institutions;Linear programming;Photobleaching;Tracking;Trajectory;Viterbi algorithm","Monte Carlo methods;biology;expectation-maximisation algorithm;fluorescence;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;optical saturable absorption;statistical analysis","EM algorithm;Monte Carlo approximation;automatical learning;fluorescent techniques;log likelihood;multiple fluorescent molecule tracking;photobleaching effect;photobleaching phenomenon;smart learning tracking machine;statistical model;stochastic modeling","","0","","15","","","28-30 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The automatic detection of tumor can be formulized as novelty detection or two-class classification issue. The method can also be used for tumor segmentation, where each voxel is to be assigned with a correct label, either a tumor class or nontumor class. A voxel is represented with a rich feature vector that distinguishes itself from voxels in different classes. A fast learning algorithm Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is trained as a voxel classifier. In automatic liver tumor detection, we propose and show that ELM can be trained as a one-class classifier with only healthy liver samples in training. It results in a method of tumor detection based on novelty detection. We compare it with two-class ELM. To extract the boundary of a tumor, we adopt the semi-automatic approach by randomly selecting samples in 3D space within a limited region of interest (ROI) for classifier training.

Unfortunately, the experimental methods for identifying PPIs are both time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is important to develop computational approaches for predicting PPIs. In this paper, a sequence-based method was developed for identifying new protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by means of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) combined with a novel representation using auto covariance (AC). The AC descriptors account for the interactions between residues a certain distance apart in the protein sequence, thus this method adequately takes the neighboring effect into account and enables us to extract more PPI information from the protein sequences. ELM is a kind of accurate and fast-learning innovative classification method based on the random generation of the input-to-hidden-units weights followed by the resolution of the linear equations to obtain the hidden-tooutput weights. When performed on the PPI data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the proposed method achieved 90.42% prediction accuracy with 90.12% sensitivity at the precision of 90.67%. Extensive experiments are performed to compare our method with state-of-the-art techniques Support Vector Machine (SVM). Achieved results show that the proposed approach is very promising for predicting PPI, and would make a helpful supplement to experimental approaches.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5891-0; POD:978-1-4673-5890-3","10.1109/MC.2013.6608211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6608211","auto covariance;extreme learning machine;protein sequence;protein-protein interaction","Accuracy;Amino acids;Predictive models;Protein sequence;Support vector machines;Training","DNA;biology computing;cellular biophysics;covariance analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);microorganisms;proteins;support vector machines","AC descriptors;DNA replication;DNA transcription;PPI;SVM;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;amino acid sequences;auto covariance descriptor;cellular processes;extreme learning machine;fast-learning innovative classification method;hidden-to-output weights;input-to-hidden-units weights;linear equations;metabolic cycles;prediction accuracy;protein sequences;protein-protein interactions;random generation;sequence-based method;signaling cascades;state-of-the-art techniques;support vector machine","","0","","25","","","16-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, a Receding Horizon Cache (RHC) structure is designed to collect training data for NN by dynamically archiving state-action pairs and actively updating their Q-values, which makes batch learning NN much easier to implement. Together with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a new RL with function approximation algorithm termed as RHC and ELM based RL (RHC-ELM-RL) is proposed.

A widely accepted approach is based on flux distribution or back EMF (BEM) model of the machine to calculate healthy phase currents. This is essentially an open-loop technique where currents are determined offline (based on motor fault models) for each fault scenario. Therefore, it is highly model-dependent. Since torque pulsation due to open-circuit faults are periodic, learning and repetitive control algorithms are excellent choices to minimize torque ripple. In this paper, iterative learning control (ILC) is applied as a current control technique for recovering performance in multiphase PM motor drives under open-circuit fault conditions. ILC-based FTC needs torque measurement, but avoids the need for complicated fault detection and fault diagnosis algorithms. Furthermore, a BEM+ILC based FTC is proposed that initiates the learning from a model-based approximate guess (from the BEM method). Therefore, this method combines the advantages of both model information as well as robustness to model uncertainty through learning. Hence, the proposed method is well-suited for high performance safety-critical applications. Finite element analysis (FEA) results on a five-phase PM machine are presented for verification of the proposed control schemes.","0743-1619;07431619","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-017-53; Electronic:978-1-4799-0178-4; POD:978-1-4799-0177-7","10.1109/ACC.2013.6580768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6580768","","Circuit faults;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Stator windings;Torque;Torque measurement","AC motor drives;adaptive control;approximation theory;electric current control;electric potential;fault tolerance;finite element analysis;iterative methods;learning systems;machine control;open loop systems;periodic control;permanent magnet motors;torque control;torque measurement","BEM;BEM+ILC based FTC;FEA;back EMF model;current control technique;electric motor drive reliability;fault-tolerance;fault-tolerant control techniques;finite element analysis;five-phase PM machine;flux distribution model;iterative learning control;maximum ripple-free torque;minimum ohmic losses;model-based approximate guess;multiphase PM motor drives;multiphase permanent-magnet machines;open-circuit fault conditions;open-loop technique;periodic control algorithm;phase current calculation;repetitive control algorithm;safety-critical applications;torque measurement;torque pulsation;torque ripple minimization","","3","","22","","","17-19 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, this work is related to the solar radiation forecasting, that affects the photovoltaic production. The variability of the weather phenomena and climate features make the prediction a difficult task. In fact, the amount of solar radiation that reaches a particular geographical location depends not only by its latitude, but also by the geographical characteristics of the region that can create local climate conditions. In order to capture such variability, the data collected in the past can be used. Several sources can provide the data needed for the prediction (satellite and ground images, numerical weather predictions, ground measurement stations) with different resolution in time and space. In this paper, a new learning paradigm, the Extreme Learning Machine, is used to train a neural network model for the prediction of the solar illuminance.

To reduce the amount of computation in model training, we propose an error-driven learning by dividing the training data into several groups and training the transliteration model step by step based on the error prediction data until the performance doesnât increase or the limitation of the computer. Experiments on data of NEWS2011 show that error-driven model training reduces computational complexity and saves the time of model training. Compared to the combining transliteration model, our transliteration system increases the accuracy of top-1 output with 0.06, reaching 0.652.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4886-9; POD:978-1-4673-6113-2","10.1109/IALP.2012.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6473732","Conditional Random Fields;Error-driven;Machine transliteration;Model training","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Conferences;Data models;Testing;Training;Training data","computational complexity;information retrieval;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;random processes","DOM;computational complexity reduction;conditional random fields;cross-lingual information retrieval;direct orthographical mapping;error-driven learning;error-driven model training;translation method;two-stage machine transliteration;word segmentation","","0","","11","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two agents compete to perform their respective jobs on a common single machine and each agent has his own criterion to optimize. The time-based learning effect of a job is assumed to be a function of the total normal processing time of the jobs scheduled in front of the job. The objective is to minimize the total completion time of the first agent with the restriction that the makespan of the second agent cannot exceed a given upper bound. The optimal properties of the problems are given, and then the optimal polynomial time algorithm is proposed to solve the scheduling problem.","2161-8151;21618151","Electronic:978-1-4673-0364-4; POD:978-1-4673-0362-0; USB:978-1-4673-0363-7","10.1109/ICAL.2012.6308156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6308156","Scheduling;Single machine;Time-based learning effect;Two-agent","Linear programming;Optimal scheduling;Processor scheduling;Programmable logic arrays;Schedules;Single machine scheduling","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;single machine scheduling","common single machine;optimal polynomial time algorithm;scheduling model;time-based learning effect;total completion time;total normal processing time;two-agent learning effect;two-agent single-machine scheduling problem;upper bound","","0","","17","","","15-17 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This algorithm is modified from the previously MMEE algorithm (see paper [X.K. Wei, Y.H. Li, Y. Feng, and G.B. Huang, ""Minimum Mahalanobis enclosing ellipsoid machine for pattern classification, "" In Proceeding of the 3th International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC'07), CCIS 2, 2007, pp.1176-1185.]) Following the idea of MMEE, this method also tries to seek a hyper-ellipsoid to enclose almost all examples from one class but excludes almost all examples from the other class at the same time. We formulate the MMEE method as a convex quadratic programming problem. To further enhance its performance, a robust version of QP-MMEE is also proposed. We validate the proposed method using real world UCI benchmark datasets.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4690-2; POD:978-1-4673-1365-0","10.1109/CSO.2012.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6274735","convex quadratic programming;minimum Mahalanobis enclosing ellipsoid;pattern recognition;reproducing kernel Hilbert space;support vector machines","Covariance matrix;Educational institutions;Ellipsoids;Quadratic programming;Support vector machines;Symmetric matrices","convex programming;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;quadratic programming","QP representable Mahalanobis ellipsoidal learning machine;QP-MMEE;UCI benchmark dataset;convex quadratic programming representable minimum Mahalanobis enclosing ellipsoid;hyperellipsoid;imbalanced data classification;pattern classification","","0","","10","","","23-26 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper an online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) algorithm adopted as training procedure for wavelet network based on serial-parallel nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model. The proposed model used as system identification for nonlinear dynamic systems. The main advantage of OSELM over conventional algorithms is the ability of updating network weights sequentially through data sample-by-sample in a single learning step. This attains good performance at extremely fast learning. The initial kernel parameters of WN played a big role to ensure fast and better learning performance. Simulation of the proposed scheme applied to nonlinear dynamic systems validates that WN-OSELM is superior in terms of identification accuracy and fast learning ability compared to NN-OSELM.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5769-2; POD:978-1-4673-5766-1; USB:978-1-4673-5768-5","10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606139","Dilation;Extreme Learning Machine (ELM);Neural Network (NN);Nonlinear ARX Model;Translation;Waveleons","Artificial neural networks;Heuristic algorithms;Mathematical model;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Robots;Training","autoregressive processes;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","NARX model;NN-OSELM;WN-OSELM;data sample-by-sample;nonlinear dynamic systems;online sequential extreme learning machine;serial-parallel nonlinear autoregressive exogenous;system identification;wavelet network","","0","","15","","","23-26 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
