"Classification vs. Regression - Machine Learning Approaches for Service Recommendation Based on Measured Consumer Experiences","J. Kirchner; A. Heberle; W. Löwe","Karlsruhe Univ. of Appl.

In order to choose the service which creates the most benefit before its consumption, a selection based on previous measurable experiences by other consumers is beneficial. In this paper, we present the results of our analysis of two machine learning approaches to predict the best service within this selection problem. The first approach focuses on classification, predicting the best performing service, while the second approach focuses on regression, predicting service performances which can then be used for the determination of the best candidate. We assessed and compared both approaches for service recommendation w.r.t. The performance gain when selecting the recommended instead of a random service. Our evaluation is based on data measured on real Web services as well as on simulated data. The latter is needed for a more profound analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The simulated data has similar statistical properties as the data measured on real Web services. In the real-world case, regression achieved a response time gain of over 92% of the optimum and classification over 83%. In case of simulated data, we could achieve an overall gain of up to 95% using classification, while regression achieved 89%.","2378-3818;23783818","Electronic:978-1-4673-7275-6; POD:978-1-4673-7276-3","10.1109/SERVICES.2015.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7196537","Machine Learning;Service Recommendation;Service Selection","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Context;Data models;Optimization;Standards;Time factors","Web services;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;recommender systems;regression analysis","Web services;classification approach;machine learning approaches;measured consumer experiences;regression approach;service functionality;service performance prediction;service recommendation","","0","","19","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is one of the promising evolutionary machine learning (EML) techniques from the viewpoint of data mining. This is because FGBML can generate accurate classifiers with linguistically interpretable fuzzy if-then rules. Of course, a classifier with tens of thousands of if-then rules is not linguistically understandable. Thus, the complexity minimization of fuzzy classifiers should be considered together with the accuracy maximization. In previous studies, we proposed hybrid FGBML and its multiobjective formulation (MoFGBML) to handle both the accuracy maximization and the complexity minimization simultaneously. MoFGBML can obtain a number of non-dominated classifiers with different tradeoffs between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we focus on heuristic rule generation in MoFGBML to improve the search performance. In the original heuristic rule generation, each if-then rule is generated from a randomly-selected training pattern in a heuristic manner. This operation is performed at population initialization and during evolution. To generate more generalized rules according to the training data, we propose new heuristic rule generation where each rule is generated from multiple training patterns. Through computational experiments using some benchmark data sets, we discuss the effects of the proposed operation on the search performance of our MoFGBML.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4799-7492-4; POD:978-1-4799-7493-1","10.1109/CEC.2015.7257262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7257262","Fuzzy genetics-based machine learning;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;heuristic rule generation","Accuracy;Complexity theory;Fuzzy sets;Genetics;Probabilistic logic;Training;Training data","computational complexity;data mining;fuzzy reasoning;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;pattern classification","EML techniques;MoFGBML;complexity minimization;data mining;evolutionary machine learning techniques;fuzzy classifier design;heuristic rule generation effects;linguistically interpretable fuzzy if-then rules;multiobjective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning;multiple training patterns;nondominated classifiers;randomly-selected training pattern;search performance","","3","","25","","","25-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper is an effort in that direction, where the effectiveness of Extreme Learning Machines(ELM) in the domain of text classification is studied and compared with many of the existing relevant techniques like Support Vector Machines(SVM), which are currently one of the most popular and effective techniques for classifying text documents. Ours is one of the few works that highlight the high performance of ELM in the field of text classification, by implementing classifiers based on different interpretations of ELM, analyzing their performance, and studying which feature selection techniques are most suited to improve their accuracy. In our multi-class classification problem, we studied a single ELM classifier based on the one-against-all scheme, and a multi-layer ELM classifier inspired from deep networks, and then perform extensive experiments on different datasets to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

Face detection is the most important and initial stage in the automatic face verification system. It helps to determine the existence of faces in an image and return the position and location of the face. The face verification system's accuracy depends on face detection. The human faces are not always frontal and have many variations, therefore, face detection is challenging in unconstrained scenarios. One main challenge of face detection is occlusion. The proposed work is an attempt to illustrate the cognitive informatics approach using machine learning and present an occluded face detection method. The proposed method uses Adaboost[1] machine learning approach. The Viola-Jones[2] algorithm along with free rectangular features[3] has been adopted in the proposed approach in order to detect faces. the machine learning methods require two operation namely training and testing. Two cascade classifiers are used in which one is trained on holistic faces and the second is trained on half occluded faces; both of the classifiers are used in parallel to work in unconfined scene. Additionally, for improvement the correctness and adeptness of the system, the skin color models are applied which are used for removing of the false positive detection. The experiment has been performed on FDDB[4] dataset. The results shows that the proposed method achieve desirable results in the detection of half occluded faces.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7289-3; Electronic:978-1-4673-7290-9; POD:978-1-4673-7291-6","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2015.7259379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7259379","blur;free rectangular features;occlusion;style;unconstrained face detection","","face recognition;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence)","Adaboost machine learning approach;FDDB dataset;Viola-Jones algorithm;automatic face verification system;cascade classifiers;cognitive informatics approach;free rectangular features;occluded face detection method;private places;public places;skin color models;unconstrained crowd scene","","3","","32","","","6-8 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, it can be used in differentiated contexts, without the need for any manual modification or intervention to the running applications. To generate optimized models, F<sup>2</sup>PM can perform a feature selection to identify, among all the measured system features, which have a major impact in the prediction of the RTTF. This allows to produce different models, which use different set of input features.

Design companies spend significant resources on static timing analysis (STA) tool licenses with signal integrity (SI) enabled. The runtime of the STA tools in SI mode is typically large due to complex algorithms and iterative calculation of timing windows to accurately determine aggressor and victim alignments, as well as delay and slew estimations. In this work, we develop machine learning-based predictors of timing in SI mode based on timing reports from non-SI mode. Timing analysis in non-SI mode is faster and the license costs can be several times less than those of SI mode. We determine electrical and logic structure parameters that affect the incremental arc delay/slew and path delay (i.e., the difference in arrival times at the clock pin of the launch flip-flop and the D pin of the capture flip-flop) in SI mode, and develop models that can predict these SI-aware delays. We report worst-case error of 7.0ps and average error of 0.7ps for our models to predict incremental transition time, worst-case error of 5.2ps and average error of 1.2ps for our models to predict incremental delay, and worst-case error of 8.2ps and average error of 1.7ps for our models to predict path delay, in 28nm FDSOI technology.

Most recommender systems aim at utilizing either non-contextual preferences or contextual preferences distinctly, while very few endeavors have been made to identify the significance of both. Hence an attempt has been made to study the influence of both, users' context dependent and context independent preferences in the single recommender system. In this case, accuracy has always been a challenge. Therefore, there exists a need for such a classification technique which can be commonly applied to both types of preferences that helps enhance the accuracy of the retrieved results. For this purpose, use of a standard Machine learning technique well known as Support Vector Machines was proposed. The idea behind using Support vector machines is to split the data in an optimal way and classify the data precisely to aid prediction purpose. For generating recommendations, these context-dependent preferences are further combined with users' context-independent preferences. Finally this technique is applied on a real-life dataset to demonstrate that our method is proficient in dealing with contextual preferences of users and well classify them to achieve better recommendation accuracy than the relative works.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1797-6; POD:978-1-4799-1798-3","10.1109/CSNT.2015.191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280093","Context;Opinion mining;Recommender System;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Context;Data mining;Recommender systems;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems","context independent preferences;context sensitive recommendations;machine learning methodology;noncontextual preferences;prediction purpose;recommender systems;support vector machines","","","","20","","","4-6 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, wireless coexistence is increasingly vulnerable to new wireless devices attempting to access the same spectrum. This paper presents a novel method for identifying wireless technologies through the use of simple energy detection techniques. Energy detection is used to measure the channel statistical temporal characteristics including activity and inactivity probability distributions. Features uniquely belonging to specific wireless technologies are extracted from the probability distributions and fed into a machine-learning algorithm to identify the technologies under evaluation. Wireless technology identification enables situational awareness to improve coexistence and reduce interference among the devices. An intelligent wireless device is capable of detecting wireless technologies operating within same vicinity. This can be performed by scanning energy levels without the need for signal demodulation and decoding. In this work, a wireless technology identification algorithm was assessed experimentally. Temporal traffic pattern for 802.11b/g/n homogeneous and heterogeneous networks were measured and used as algorithm input.

The problem is formulated as an optimization problem where the optimal solution is obtained using a machine-learning theoretical graph-based method. In particular, first the fundus photograph is registered to the 2D projection of the SD-OCT volume. Three in-region cost functions are designed using a random forest classifier corresponding to three regions of cup, rim, and background. Next, the volumes are resampled to create radial scans in which the Bruch's Membrane Opening (BMO) endpoints are easier to detect. Similar to in-region cost function design, the disc-boundary cost function is designed using a random forest classifier for which the features are created by applying the Haar Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) to the radial projection image. A multisurface graph-based approach utilizes the in-region and disc-boundary cost images to segment the boundaries of optic disc and cup under feasibility constraints. The approach is evaluated on 25 multimodal image pairs from 25 subjects in a leave-one-out fashion (by subject). The performances of the graph-theoretic approach using three sets of cost functions are compared: 1) using unimodal (OCT only) in-region costs, 2) using multimodal in-region costs, and 3) using multimodal in-region and disc-boundary costs. Results show that the multimodal approaches outperform the unimodal approach in segmenting the optic disc and cup.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2015.2412881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060704","Bruch's membrane opening;SD-OCT;multimodal;ophthalmology;optic disc;retina;segmentation","Biomedical optical imaging;Cost function;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Optical imaging;Urban areas","Haar transforms;biomedical optical imaging;eye;graph theory;image classification;image registration;image sampling;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;optical tomography;wavelet transforms","2D projection;Bruch membrane opening endpoints;Haar stationary wavelet transform;SD-OCT volume;color fundus photographs;cup boundaries;disc-boundary cost function;in-region cost functions;machine-learning theoretical graph-based method;multimodal image pairs;multimodal segmentation;multisurface graph-based approach;optic disc boundaries;optimization problem;radial projection image;radial scans;random forest classifier;spectral domain optical coherence tomography volumes","0","5","","32","","20150313","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Three representative machine learning models, linear regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) are developed, respectively. The results show that neither direct nor iterative forecasting can always outperform each other in terms of all the error measures.

Commercial and government Web servers have become the primary target of these kinds of attacks, with the recent mitigation efforts struggling to deaden the problem efficiently. Most application layer DDoS attacks can successfully mimic legitimate traffic without being detected by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). IDSs and IPSs can also mistake a normal and legitimate activity for a malicious one, producing a False Positive (FP) that affects Web users if it is ignored or dropped. False positives in a large and complex network topology can potentially be dangerous as they may cause IDS/IPS to block the user's benign traffic. Our focus and contributions in this paper are first, to mitigate the undetected malicious traffic mimicking legitimate traffic and developing a special anti-DDoS module for general and specific DDoS tools attacks by using a trained classifier in a random tree machine-learning algorithm. We use labeled datasets to generate rules to incorporate and fine-tune existing IDS/IPS such as Snort. Secondly, we further assist IDS/IPS by processing traffic that is classified as malicious by the IDS/IPS in order to identify FPs and route them to their intended destinations. To achieve this, our approach uses active authentication of traffic source of both legitimate and malicious traffic at the Bait and Decoy server respectively before destined to the Web server.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6564-2; POD:978-1-4673-6565-9","10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273365","DDoS Mitigation;False Positives;IDS/IPS;Java Script;Machine Learning","Authentication;Computer crime;Logic gates;Training;Web servers","Internet;computer network security;file servers;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","FP;IDS;IPS;Web server protection;Web users;application layer DDoS attacks;bait-and-decoy server;destination servers;distributed denial of service;false positive;government Web servers;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention systems;legitimate traffic;malicious traffic;minimal computational resources;mitigation efforts;random tree machine-learning algorithm;traffic authentication;traffic source active authentication;trained classifier","","1","","13","","","1-5 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The prediction of DDIs for avoiding the adverse effects is an important issue. There are many drug-drug interaction pairs, it is impossible to do in vitro or in vivo experiments for all the possible pairs. The limitation of DDIs research is the high costs. Many drug interactions are due to alterations in drug metabolism by enzymes. The most common among these enzymes are cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450). Drugs can be substrate, inhibitor or inducer of CYP450 which will affect metabolite of other drugs. This paper proposes enzyme action crossing attribute creation for DDIs prediction. Machine learning techniques, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Neural Networks (NNs), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to find DDIs for simvastatin based on enzyme action crossing. SVM preformed the best providing the predictions at the accuracy of 70.40 % and of 81.85 % with balance and unbalance class label datasets respectively.

These changes require tighter controls on processes and measurements to achieve the required device performance, and challenge the metrology and process control in terms of capability and quality. Predictive metrology and analytics offer Multivariate data with non-linear trends and complex correlations generally cannot be described well by mathematical models but can be relatively easily learned by computing machines and used to predict or extrapolate. In this paper we present the application of machine learning and analytics to accurately predict the electrical performance of deep trenches and metal lines. Machine learning models can be used in process control where, for example, the electrical test results are predicted early in the processing flow invoking appropriate actionable decisions. It is demonstrated that metal line resistance can be modeled directly by the raw reflectance spectra obtained using scatterometry tool. This obviates the need to make complex geometrical models to measure the CDs and then establishing the correlation of CDs to resistance. It is shown that dimensional parameters such as height and CD can be derived from the predicted electrical measurements. Such information can be used in feedforward or feedback flow to optimize, control or monitor processes in fab. Results show improved correlation of neural network model predicted deep trench capacitance to the measured capacitance compared to the capacitance predicted by multivariate linear regression model that is currently in use. This paper presents the concept of predictive metrology with the use of machine learning and predictive analytics for CD and electrical test predictions.

In many situations, sensors cannot be placed arbitrarily, either because of their geometry or because of the environment they are in.

There are a number of approaches for detecting vulnerabilities from source code, but commercial off the shelf components are, in general, distributed in binary form. Before using such third-party components it is imperative to check for presence of vulnerabilities. We investigate the use of static analysis and machine learning for predicting buffer overflow vulnerabilities from binaries in this study. To mitigate buffer overflows, developers typically perform size checks and input validation. We propose static code attributes characterizing buffer usage and defense mechanisms implemented in the code for preventing buffer overflows. The proposed approach starts by identifying potential vulnerable statement constructs during binary program analysis and extracts static code attributes for each of them as per proposed characterization scheme to capture buffer usage patterns and defensive mechanisms employed in the code. Data mining methods are then used on these collected code attributes for predicting buffer overflows. Our experimental evaluation on standard buffer overflow benchmark binaries shows that the proposed static code attributes are effective in predicting buffer overflow vulnerabilities.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6564-2; POD:978-1-4673-6565-9","10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273653","binary static analysis;buffer overflow;buffer usage pattern;control and data dependency;disassembly;static code attributes;vulnerability prediction","Buffer overflows;Containers;Filling;Libraries;Registers;Semantics;Software","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;security of data;source code (software)","binary program analysis;buffer overflow vulnerability prediction;buffer usage patterns;data mining methods;machine learning;software vulnerability prediction;source code;static analysis;static code attributes;x86 executables","","","","27","","","1-5 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the positioning literature, machine learning algorithms have widespread usage in estimating positions. One of the main problems in indoor positioning systems is to find out appropriate machine learning algorithm. In this paper, selected machine learning algorithms are compared in terms of positioning accuracy and computation time. In the experiments, UJIIndoorLoc indoor positioning database is used.

Early and late fusion scenarios are distinguished, and appropriate factor models for the respective scenarios are presented along with example applications from selected multimodal neuroimaging studies. Further emphasis is given to the interpretability of the resulting model parameters, in particular by highlighting how factor models relate to physical models needed for source localization.

Previous works are mostly developed using image processing and decisions are often made using empirical functions, which makes it difficult to be generalized. Hereby, we propose a general framework for object detection and classification, aimed at video-based intelligent transportation applications. It is a two-step approach. The detection is carried out using binarized normed gradient (BING) method. PCA network (PCANet) is employed for object classification. Both BING and PCANet are among the latest algorithms in the field of machine learning. Practically the proposed method is applied to a road marking dataset with 1,443 road images. We randomly choose 60% images for training and use the remaining 40% images for testing. Upon training, the system can detect 9 classes of road markings with an accuracy better than 96.8%.

So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well.

The proposed GP-ELM algorithm initializes a SLNN by using extreme learning algorithm (ELM) algorithm given superfluous number of hidden nodes. The following of GP-ELM algorithm consists of two iterative processes. First, the significance of each hidden nodes is estimated and the insignificant nodes are removed. Secondly, the existing hidden nodes are updated by using ELM algorithm. These two processes continue until the stop condition is satisfied such that a reasonably compact network is achieved. Compared against other state-of-the-art algorithms, GP-ELM algorithm has mainly two improvements. First, a supervised training process is integrated into the pruning process such that significance of each hidden node can be estimated more precisely in the next iteration. Secondly, the pruning threshold is set based on the input data dimension such that the threshold can accommodate any data type. Experimental results have shown that the GP-ELM algorithm can automatically achieve a reasonable compact network structure while keep comparable or much higher accuracy in classification and regression.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9104-7; POD:978-1-4673-9105-4; USB:978-1-4673-9103-0","10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279511","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7279511","Generalized pruning;extreme learning machine;single-hidden-layer neural network","Accuracy;Cost function;Diabetes;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Support vector machines;Training","decision trees;estimation theory;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","GP-ELM algorithm;SLNN;generalized pruning extreme learning machine;hidden node estimation;iterative process;single-hidden-layer neural network;supervised training process","","","","21","","","8-10 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposed power and thermal management method is based on a heuristic approach to speed up the convergence of the machine learning algorithm which makes it applicable for general purpose processors. Adopting Q-Learning as the machine learning algorithm, the heuristic approach aids to limit the learning space by suggesting the most appropriate actions to the agent in each decision epoch. The heuristic algorithm employs the current and previous states of the machine learning, as well as the amount of the temperature stress and power consumption of each core to determine the appropriate action for each core, independently.

Considering the above two statements it can assume that people tend to associate music with certain activity if it induces emotions that are in sync with it. In today's world of infinite storage, the number of songs that a user has is ever increasing. With the increased number of songs, listening music in a way one likes has become difficult. Playlist provide us a way to better organize our music library. These can be created manually or by using various smart playlist creators that generates them by analyzing various components of music files used by the user. In the current scenario the playlist created has a specific number of tracks which are played over and over again, with the only variation occurring being in the order in which songs are played. Also the songs that are not part of any playlist are left redundant, occupying useful memory. Our work focuses on the reducing the number of redundant songs in the music library while creating playlist. We have worked on grouping songs with similar emotional effect together in a segment, and then creating a dynamic playlist every time the user plays music. The results show that as the system is provided with required input, we get a robust playlist for each segment, which consist of diverse mix of songs having similar emotional perception.

It can obtain fuzzy rule-based classifiers that are accurate and linguistically interpretable for human users. However, there are two major problems. One is that it is impossible to design the best classifier with respect to both accuracy and interpretability due to their tradeoff. To solve this problem, we proposed multiobjective FGBML (MoFGBML) where an evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm is used to obtain a number of classifiers with different tradeoffs between accuracy and complexity. The other is the heavy computational load of FGBML for large data sets. In the previous study, we applied parallel distributed implementation to our MoFGBML to overcome this problem. We examined the effects of the parallel distributed implementation on the search ability. Although the computational time became much shorter, the number of the obtained non-dominated classifiers became small. As a result, accurate classifiers were not obtained for some data sets. In this paper, we propose a simple idea to bias the search direction of our MoFGBML. We rotate one or two objective functions. This rotation changes the dominance relation in multiobjective optimization. Through computational experiments, we examine the effects of the rotated objective functions on the search ability of our MoFGBML for large data sets.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7862-5; POD:978-1-4799-7863-2","10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244890","Fuzzy genetics-based machine learning;multiobjective optimization;parallel distributed implementation","Accuracy;Data models;Error analysis;Linear programming;Sociology;Statistics;Training data","data mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems","MoFGBML;computational load;computational time;data mining techniques;distributed multiobjective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning;evolutionary computation;fuzzy rule-based classifiers;multiobjective FGBML;nondominated classifiers;objective functions;rotation effects;search ability","","1","","20","","","May 31 2015-June 3 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Modelling time-varying delays in networked automation systems with heterogeneous networks using machine learning techniques","S. Srinivasan; F. Buonopane; G. Saravanakumar; B. Subathra; S. Ramaswamy","Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy","2015 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)","20151008","2015","","","362","368","Time-varying delays affect the performance and reliability of networked automation systems (NAS). Recent trend to use wired and wireless networks within NAS induces network delays that vary depending on many factors such as loading, sharing, length of the channel, protocol, and so on. As these factors are inherently time-varying, developing analytical models capturing the effect of all these parameters is complex. This investigation presents a methodology that combines experiments with machine learning techniques to model time-varying delays in networked automation systems integrated with heterogeneous networks. Experiments are conducted on NAS by varying the factors that influence delays and time stamping obtained using Wireshark are used to compute the delay. The data collected on the factors influencing the delays and the corresponding delay values are used to model the delays. In data-mining techniques, the accuracy of the estimates varies with the number of computing elements in the hidden layer and selecting them using trial-and-error approach is cumbersome. The minimum resource allocation network (MRAN) over comes the short-coming as it decides the number of computing elements (neurons) in the hidden layer using error thresholds and pruning strategy. The data collected from the experiment is the input training set to the MRAN. Once trained, the MRAN model gives a functional representation relating the factors affecting delays and the estimated delay for a given network condition. During testing, MRAN estimates are validated using error measurements. Results show that the MRAN delay model can capture delays with good accuracy and can be used a tool to assist design decisions on engineering automation systems with heterogeneous networks. The proposed model gives a framework to model time-varying delays as a function of factors influencing them and can be modified to include any number of parameters.

Often times big data such as healthcare systems or financial systems may involve with multiple organizations who may have different privacy policy, and may not explicitly share their data publicly while joint data processing may be a must. Thus, how to share big data among distributed data processing entities while mitigating privacy concerns becomes a challenging problem. Traditional methods rely on cryptographic tools and/or randomization to preserve privacy. Unfortunately, this alone may be inadequate for the emerging big data systems because they are mainly designed for traditional small-scale data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to achieve privacy-preserving machine learning where the training data are distributed and each shared data portion is of large volume. Specifically, we utilize the data locality property of Apache Hadoop architecture and only a limited number of cryptographic operations at the Reduce() procedures to achieve privacy-preservation.

As machine learning techniques become more mainstream, they are being applied to a wider range of application domains. These algorithms are now trusted to make critical decisions in secure and adversarial environments such as healthcare, fraud detection, and network security, in which mistakes can be incredibly costly. They are also a critical component to most modern autonomous systems. However, the data driven approach utilized by these machine learning methods can prove to be a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted by either nefarious or accidental means. Models that utilize on-line learning or periodic retraining to learn new patterns and account for data distribution changes are particularly susceptible to corruption through model drift. In modeling this type of scenario, specially crafted data points are added to the training set over time to adversely influence the system, inducing model drift which leads to incorrect classifications. Our work is focused on exploring the resistance of various machine learning algorithms to such an approach.

In this paper, we develop two different mathematical attacks on previously proposed lightweight PUF circuits, namely composite PUF and the multibit output lightweight secure PUF (LSPUF). We show that independence of various components of composite PUF can be used to develop divide and conquer attacks which can be used to determine the responses to unknown challenges. We reduce the complexity of the attack using a machine learning-based modeling analysis. In addition, we elucidate a special property of the output network of LSPUF to show how such feature can be leveraged by an adversary to perform an intelligent model building attack. The theoretical inferences are validated through experimental results. More specifically, proposed attacks on composite PUF are validated using the challenge-response pairs (CRPs) from its field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation, and attack on LSPUF is validated using the CRPs of both simulated and FPGA implemented LSPUF.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131531","Composite PUF;PUF;cryptanalysis;lightweight secure;modeling attack","Computational modeling;Cryptography;Hardware;Integrated circuit reliability;Partitioning algorithms","","","","4","","11","","20150623","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In spite of the fact that most of the current methods to track motion are based on optoelectronic systems and wearable inertial sensors, promising solutions could spring from the application of passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. When the human body's limbs move within an electromagnetic field radiated by an interrogating antenna, a movement-dependent modulation of the backscattered field is sensed by the remote receiver. The collected signals, properly conditioned by wearable electromagnetic markers (tags), may therefore carry intrinsic information about human motion. This article investigates the potentiality of the synergy between electromagnetics and machine-learning technologies to classify gestures of arms and legs by using only passive and sensorless transponders. The electromagnetic signals, backscattered from the tags during gestures, are collected by a fixed reader antenna and processed by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to recognize periodic limb movements and classify more complex random motion patterns. Experimental sessions demonstrated a classification accuracy higher than 80-90%, which is comparable to more complex systems involving active wearable transceivers. The results further indicate that the achievable bit rate is 48 b/min, suggesting that the platform could be used to input coded controls to a gesture-oriented user interface.","1045-9243;10459243","","10.1109/MAP.2015.2437274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163526","","Antenna measurements;Frequency measurement;Human computer interaction;Motion detection;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Support vector machines","gesture recognition;human computer interaction;image classification;image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);radiofrequency identification;support vector machines;transceivers;transponders","RFID technology;SVM algorithm;active wearable transceivers;backscattered field;complex random motion pattern classification;electromagnetic field;electromagnetic signals;entertainment application;fixed reader antenna;gesture classification;gesture-oriented user interface;human body segments;human-computer interaction;interrogating antenna;machine learning;medical application;motion tracking;movement detection;movement-dependent modulation;optoelectronic systems;passive radio-frequency identification technology;passive transponder;periodic limb movement recognition;remote receiver;sensorless transponder;support vector machine algorithm;wearable electromagnetic markers;wearable inertial sensors","","2","","24","","20150721","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, controversy remains regarding the best anthropometric indicators of the HDL and LDL cholesterol levels. The objectives of this study were to identify the best predictors of HDL and LDL cholesterol using statistical analyses and two machine learning algorithms and to compare the predictive power of combined anthropometric measures in Korean adults. A total of 13 014 subjects participated in this study. The anthropometric measures were assessed with binary logistic regression (LR) to evaluate statistically significant differences between the subjects with normal and high LDL cholesterol levels and between the subjects with normal and low HDL cholesterol levels. LR and the naive Bayes algorithm (NB), which provides more reasonable and reliable results, were used in the analyses of the predictive power of individual and combined measures. The best predictor of HDL was the rib to hip ratio (p = <; 0.0001; odds ratio (OR) = 1.895; area under curve (AUC) = 0.681) in women and the waist to hip ratio (WHR) (p = <;0.0001; (OR) = 1.624; AUC = 0.633) in men. In women, the strongest indicator of LDL was age (p = <;0.0001; OR = 1.662; AUC by NB = 0.653); AUC byLR = 0.636. Among the anthropometric measures, the body mass index (BMI), WHR, forehead to waist ratio, forehead to rib ratio, and forehead to chest ratio were the strongest predictors of LDL; these measures had similar predictive powers. The strongest predictor in men was BMI (p = <;0.0001; OR = 1.369; AUC by NB = 0.594; AUC by LR = 0.595). The predictive power of almost all individual anthrop- metric measures was higher for HDL than for LDL, and the predictive power for both HDL and LDL in women was higher than for men. A combination of anthropometric measures slightly improved the predictive power for both HDL and LDL cholesterol. The best indicator for HDL and LDL might differ according to the type of cholesterol and the gender. In women, but not men, age was the variable that strongly predicted HDL and LDL cholesterol levels. Our findings provide new information for the development of better initial screening tools for HDL and LDL cholesterol.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2014.2350014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880767","Anthropometry;classification;data mining;high-density lipoproteins (HDLs);low-density lipoproteins (LDLs);machine learning;predictor;statistical data analysis","Biomedical measurement;Forehead;Hardware design languages;Hip;Neck;Niobium;Power measurement","anthropometry;biochemistry;biomedical measurement;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;proteins;sensitivity analysis;statistical analysis","anthropometric predictor identification;area under curve;binary logistic regression;body mass index;diseases;forehead-chest ratio;forehead-rib ratio;forehead-waist ratio;machine learning algorithms and;naive Bayes algorithm;rib-hip ratio;serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels;serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels;statistical analysis;waist-hip ratio","0","0","","56","","20140820","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we focus on optimizing the Hadoop MapReduce job performance by tuning configuration parameters, and then we propose an analytical method to help system administrators choose approximately optimal configuration parameters depending on the characteristics of each application. Our approach has two key phases: prediction and optimization phase.

The method that can predict such customers' needs can be profitable to the banks for improving their marketing campaign strategies. Unfortunately, it is very hard to predict the customers' needs because the available information is asymmetric. In this paper, we propose the method to analyze asymmetric information using SMOTE algorithm and Rotation Forest (PCA)-J48. The SMOTE method is used to modify the data and improve the accuracy of the prediction. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared to Decision Tree, Rotation Forest, Navie Bayes, BayesNet, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, RBF Neural Network. The experimental results show the predicting accuracies of all predictors. The experiments show that Rotation Forest (PCA)- J48 can achieve the highest value of accuracy and specificity.

OpenCL has been proposed as a standard for programing such systems, and offers functional portability. It does, however, suffer from poor performance portability, code tuned for one device must be re-tuned to achieve good performance on another device. In this paper, we use machine learning-based auto-tuning to address this problem. Benchmarks are run on a random subset of the entire tuning parameter configuration space, and the results are used to build an artificial neural network based model.

Video rate adaptation is a key to determine the video quality of HTTP-based media streaming. Recent works have proposed several algorithms that allow a DASH client to adapt its video encoding rate to network dynamics. While network conditions are typically affected by many different factors, these algorithms however usually consider only a few representative information, e.g., predicted available bandwidth or fullness of its playback buffer. In addition, the error in bandwidth estimation could significantly degrade their performance. Therefore, this paper presents Machine Learning-based Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MLASH), an elastic framework that exploits a wide range of useful network-related features to train a rate classification model. The distinct properties of MLASH are that its machine learning-based framework can be incorporated with any existing adaptation algorithm and utilize big data characteristics to improve prediction accuracy. We show via trace-based simulations that machine learning-based adaptation can achieve a better performance than traditional adaptation algorithms in terms of their target quality of experience (QoE) metrics.","1945-7871;19457871","Electronic:978-1-4799-7082-7; POD:978-1-4799-7083-4","10.1109/ICME.2015.7177418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7177418","HTTP Streaming;Machine Learning;Rate Adaptation","Bandwidth;Lead;Servers;Streaming media;Training","feature selection;hypermedia;learning (artificial intelligence);media streaming;pattern classification;quality of experience;video coding","DASH client;HTTP-based media streaming;HTTP-based streaming;MLASH;QoE metrics;adaptation algorithm;bandwidth estimation;big data characteristics;dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP;elastic feature selection;machine learning based rate adaptation;machine learning-based adaptation;machine learning-based adaptive streaming over HTTP;machine learning-based framework;network condition;network dynamics;network-related feature;playback buffer;prediction accuracy;rate classification model;representative information;target quality of experience metrics;trace-based simulation;video encoding rate;video quality;video rate adaptation","","2","","10","","","June 29 2015-July 3 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Failure of the levees can result in loss of life and property. Slough slides are among the problems which can lead to complete levee failure during a high water event. In this paper, we develop a method to detect such slides using X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Our proposed methodology includes: radiometric normalization of the TerraSAR image using high-resolution digital elevation map (DEM) data; extraction of features including backscatter and texture features from the levee; a feature selection method based on minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR); and training a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and testing on the area of interest. To validate the proposed methodology, ground-truth data are collected from slides and healthy areas of the levee. The study area is part of the levee system along the lower Mississippi River in the United States. The output classes are healthy and slide areas of the levee. The results show the average classification accuracies of approximately 0.92 and Cohen's kappa measures of 0.85 for both healthy and slide pixels using ten optimal features selected by mRMR with a sigmoid SVM. A comparison of the SVM performance to the maximum likelihood (ML) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) shows that the average accuracy of the SVM is superior to that of the BPNN and ML classifiers.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2427337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110549","Feature extraction;feature selection;hazards;support vector machine (SVM);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Levee;Remote sensing;Support vector machines;Synthetic aperture radar;Terrain factors","backpropagation;digital elevation models;feature extraction;feature selection;geomorphology;geophysical image processing;image classification;image resolution;image texture;maximum likelihood estimation;neural nets;radar imaging;radar resolution;radiometry;spaceborne radar;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","BPNN;Cohen kappa;DEM;Earthen levees;ML classifier;Mississippi river;TerraSAR imaging;United States;X-band synthetic aperture radar data;back propagation neural network;backscatter;feature extraction;high-resolution digital elevation map;landslide detection;mRMR;machine learning framework;maximum likelihood classifier;minimum redundancy maximum relevance;radiometric normalization;sigmoid SVM classifier;spaceborne SAR imagery;support vector machine classifier;texture feature selection method;training","","1","","40","","20150520","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Internal corrosion is one of the most dangerous damage mechanisms active in pipelines. Since it is due to interaction of different mechanisms, a large degree of uncertainty is associated with the attempt of quantifying a prediction for the future evolution of damage. Existing models rarely reproduce field data. Given high nonlinearity of the corrosion process, a Machine Learning approach has been investigated, focusing on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). In particular, an ensemble of ANNs is generated. This strategy strongly improves the results obtained not only by deterministic models, usually considered in literature, but also by single ANN models. Given the high uncertainty inherent to real internal corrosion problem, results from Machine Learning approach are promising.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8736-8; POD:978-1-4799-8737-5","10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7271592","artificial neural networks;ensemble averaging;machine learning;pipeline corrosion","Artificial neural networks;Corrosion;Fitting;Loss measurement;Metals;Pipelines;Predictive models","corrosion;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pipelines","artificial neural networks;corrosion assessment;damage mechanisms;hydrocarbons;internal corrosion;machine learning approach;subsea pipelines","","","","12","","","18-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many traditional machine learning methods suffer from the imbalanced data which are also collected in online sequential manner. To get fast and efficient classification for this special problem, a new online sequential extreme learning machine method with sequential SMOTE strategy is proposed. The key idea of this method is to reduce the randomness while generating virtual minority samples by means of the distribution characteristic of online sequential data. Utilizing online-sequential extreme learning machine as baseline algorithm, this method contains two stages. In offline stage, principal curve is introduced to model the each class's distribution based on which some virtual samples are generated by synthetic minority over-sampling technique(SMOTE). In online stage, each class's membership is determined according to the projection distance of sample to principal curve. With the help of these memberships, the redundant majority samples as well as unreasonable virtual minority samples are all excluded to lighten the imbalance level in online stage. The proposed method is evaluated on four UCI datasets and the real-world air pollutant forecasting dataset. The experimental results show that, the proposed method outperforms the classical ELM, OS-ELM and SMOTE-based OS-ELM in terms of generalization performance and numerical stability.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4799-1960-4; POD:978-1-4799-1961-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280620","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280620","","Classification algorithms;Niobium;Prediction algorithms;Standards","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sampling methods","UCI datasets;air pollutant forecasting dataset;data imbalance problems;imbalanced data online sequential classification;machine learning;online sequential extreme learning machine method;pattern recognition;redundant majority samples;sequential SMOTE strategy;synthetic minority oversampling technique;virtual minority samples","","","","14","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm.
