In this work, each story is divided into three parts: (i) introduction, (ii) main and (iii) climax. The objective of this work is to explore how story genre information is embedded in different parts of the story. We are proposing a framework for story classification using keyword and Part-of-speech (POS) based features. Keyword based features like Term Frequency (TF) and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) are used. Classification performance is analyzed for different story parts using various combinations of features with three classifiers: (i) Naive Bayes (NB), (ii) k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and (iii) Support Vector Machine (SVM). From the experimental studies, it has been observed that classification performance has not significantly improved by combining linguistic (POS) and keyword based features. Among classifiers, SVM outperformed the other classifiers. The main part of the story has the highest classification accuracy compared to introduction and climax parts of the story.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8792-4; POD:978-1-4799-8793-1; USB:978-1-4799-8791-7","10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275822","Climax;Introduction;KNN;Main;Naive Bayes;Part-of-Speech;SVM;Story Classification;Structure of Story;Text-to-Speech;Vector Space Model","Accuracy;Handheld computers;Informatics;Machine learning algorithms;Niobium;Support vector machines;Text categorization","Bayes methods;document handling;linguistics;natural language processing;pattern classification;speech synthesis;support vector machines","Hindi story classification;KNN classifier;NB classifier;POS based feature;SVM classifier;TFIDF;Telugu story classification;children story classification;classification performance;classify;fable;folk-tale;k-nearest neighbour classifier;keyword based features;legend;linguistic;naive Bayes classifier;part-of-speech;story genre information;story speech synthesis system;story structure;support vector machine classifier;term frequency inverse document frequency","","1","","17","","","10-13 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To accelerate CNN computations, various GPU-based or application-specific hardware approaches have been recently proposed. However, since they require large computing hardware and absolute energy amount, they are not suitable for embedded applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accelerate CNN computations using a CGRA (Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Architecture) for low-power embedded systems. We first present a new CGRA with distributed scratchpad memory blocks for efficient temporal blocking to reduce memory bandwidth pressure. We then show the architecture of our CNN accelerator using the CGRA with some dedicated software implementation. We evaluated our approach by comparing some existing platforms, such as high-end and mobile GPUs, and general multicore CPUs.

Multimedia mining is a form of data mining. Data mining uses algorithms to segment data to identify useful patterns and to make predictions. Despite the successes in many areas, data mining remains a challenging task. In the past, multimedia mining was one of the fields where the results were often not satisfactory. Multimedia Data Mining extracts relevant data from multimedia files such as audio, video and still images to perform similarity searches, identify associations, entity resolution and for classification. As the mining techniques have matured, new techniques were developed. A lot of progress has been made in areas such as visual data mining and natural language processing using deep learning techniques. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning and has been used among other on Smartphones for face recognition and voice commands. Deep learners are a type of artificial neural networks with multiple data processing layers that learn representations by increasing the level of abstraction from one layer to the next. These methods have improved the state-of-the-art in multimedia mining, in speech recognition, visual object recognition, natural language processing and other areas such as genome mining and predicting the efficacy of drug molecules. This paper describes some of the deep learning techniques that have been used in recent research for multimedia data mining.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-6831-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-6832-2; POD:978-1-4673-6833-9","10.1109/ICDIPC.2015.7323027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7323027","artificial neural networks;data mining;deep learning;multimedia data mining;natural language processing;visual data mining","Backpropagation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Multimedia communication;Training;Visualization","Internet;data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia computing;neural nets;pattern classification","Internet;artificial neural networks;association identification;audio files;classification;data segmentation;deep learning;entity resolution;machine learning;multimedia data mining;multimedia files;multiple data processing layers;relevant data extraction;similarity search;still images;useful pattern identification;video files","","2","","29","","","7-9 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this sense, a new approach to detect fetal QRS (fQRS) complexes from abdominal maternal ECG signals is proposed in this paper. First, signals were segmented into contiguous frames of 250 ms duration and then labeled in four classes. Principal component analysis was applied on Haar-Wavelet transform for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, and interquartile ranges and sampling without replacement were employed to deal with outliers and imbalanced class problems, respectively. K-nearest neighborhood (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and Bayesian network (BN) were trained and tested on the ECG signals of four electrodes of the PhysioNet/CinC challenge 2013 dataset, using 10-fold stratified cross-validation. Results show that KNN and SVM got better average accuracies over BN, that reach to 89.59% and 89.19%, respectively. Although KNN yielded better results, SVM was less time-consuming in prediction. In addition, the fourth electrode signals are less noisy and contain more representative data that helps SVM reaches an accuracy about 80% for fQRS estimation.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9461-1; POD:978-1-4673-9462-8; USB:978-1-4673-9460-4","10.1109/STSIVA.2015.7330451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7330451","","Electrocardiography;Electrodes;Estimation;Machine learning algorithms;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Transforms","Haar transforms;belief networks;cardiovascular system;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;obstetrics;principal component analysis;signal classification;support vector machines;wavelet transforms","10-fold stratified cross-validation;Bayesian network;ECG signals;Haar wavelet transform;K-nearest neighborhood;KNN;SVM;abdominal maternal ECG recordings;abdominal maternal ECG signals;cardiovascular system;electrode signals;fQRS estimation;feature extraction;fetal QRS classification;fetal QRS complexes;fetal heart rate monitoring;fetus;imbalanced class problems;noisy;physioNet-CinC challenge 2013 dataset;principal component analysis;signal segmentation;support vector machine","","","","15","","","2-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this framework, the human demonstrator learns to control the robot in real-time to make it perform a given task. At the same time, the robot learns from the human guided control creating a non-trivial coupled dynamical system. The research question we address is how this system can be tuned to facilitate faster skill transfer or improve the performance level of the transferred skill. In the current paper we report our initial work for the latter. At the beginning of the skill transfer session, the human demonstrator controls the robot exclusively as in teleoperation. As the task performance improves the robot takes increasingly more share in control, eventually reaching full autonomy. The proposed framework is implemented and shown to work on a physical cart-pole setup. To assess whether simultaneous learning has advantage over the standard sequential learning (where the robot learns from the human observation but does not interfere with the control) experiments with two groups of subjects were performed. The results indicate that the final autonomous controller obtained via simultaneous learning has a higher performance measured as the average deviation from the upright posture of the pole.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7509-2; POD:978-1-4673-7510-8","10.1109/ICAR.2015.7251437","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7251437","Human-Robot Interaction;Human-in-the-loop;Skill Transfer","Education;Machine learning algorithms;Real-time systems;Robot control;Service robots;Standards","human-robot interaction;intelligent robots;telerobotics","autonomous controller;human guided control;human-in-the loop robot skill synthesis framework;nontrivial coupled dynamical system;performance level improvement;physical cart-pole system;robot control;robot learning;simultaneous human-robot adaptation;simultaneous learning;skill transfer;teleoperation","","1","","30","","","27-31 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, rough intuitionistic fuzzy c-means algorithm has been proposed by Tripathy et al [3] and they established its supremacy over all other algorithms contained in the same set. Replacing the Euclidean distance metric with kernel induced metric makes it possible to cluster the objects which are linearly inseparable in the original space. In this paper a comparative analysis is performed over the Gaussian, hyper tangent and radial basis kernel functions by their application on various vague clustering approaches like rough c-means (RCM), intuitionistic fuzzy c-means (IFCM), rough fuzzy c-means (RFCM) and rough intuitionistic fuzzy c-means (RIFCM). All clustering algorithms have been tested on synthetic, user knowledge modeling and human activity recognition datasets taken from UCI repository against the standard accuracy indexes for clustering. The results reveal that for small sized datasets Gaussian kernel produces more accurate clustering than radial basis and hyper tangent kernel functions however for the datasets which are considerably large hyper tangent kernel is superior to other kernel functions.

In the context of reinforcement learning, the learning rate controls how fast we modify our estimates. Generally Q-learning approach leverages the temporal-difference (TD) error to regulate Q-value, while utilizing a constant or decreasing learning rate, e.g., linear or polynomial learning rate, throughout the agent's life. Learning algorithm with polynomial learning rate learns faster at the cost of inferior trade-off between exploration and exploitation. None of them is evaluated based on the TD error. Whereas that cannot psychologically reflect the agent's true learning progress with unnecessary extra training episodes and exploration. This paper proposes an error-sensitive learning rate mechanism for Q-learning algorithm termed as (ESQL) to achieve better mitigation and faster learning. The agent is endowed sensibility to the TD error summed over the episodes. The derived method is implemented with indoor robot navigation task simulation in a stationary grid world environment.

Specifically, our DTML learns a deep metric network by maximizing the inter-class variations and minimizing the intra-class variations, and minimizing the distribution divergence between the source domain and the target domain at the top layer of the network. To better exploit the discriminative information from the source domain, we further develop a deeply supervised transfer metric learning (DSTML) method by including an additional objective on DTML where the output of both the hidden layers and the top layer are optimized jointly.

We explore the effect that translations have on the measures, when the cost function is defined within a bound-constrained region. Furthermore, we examine the robustness of the neighborhood structure after dimensionality reduction. The results demonstrate that a measure may transition abruptly due a translation. Therefore, we should not generalize the measures of an instance nor report average values of a measure as belonging to the generating function.

In scene classification, effective feature selection can significantly boost the final performance. In this letter, a novel deep-learning-based feature-selection method is proposed, which formulates the feature-selection problem as a feature reconstruction problem. Note that the popular deep-learning technique, i.e., the deep belief network (DBN), achieves feature abstraction by minimizing the reconstruction error over the whole feature set, and features with smaller reconstruction errors would hold more feature intrinsics for image representation. Therefore, the proposed method selects features that are more reconstructible as the discriminative features. Specifically, an iterative algorithm is developed to adapt the DBN to produce the inquired reconstruction weights. In the experiments, 2800 remote sensing scene images of seven categories are collected for performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2015.2475299","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272047","Deep belief network (DBN);feature learning;iterative deep learning;scene recognition;scene understanding","Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Machine learning;Remote sensing;Satellites;Testing;Training","belief networks;feature selection;geophysical image processing;image classification;image representation;iterative methods;remote sensing","deep belief network;deep learning based feature selection;feature abstraction;feature reconstruction problem;high-resolution satellite images;image representation;iterative algorithm;remote sensing scene classification;remote sensing scene images;remote sensing scene recognition","","9","","17","","20150918","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the proposed architecture, the PCA is employed to learn multistage filter banks. This is followed by simple binary hashing and block histograms for indexing and pooling. This architecture is thus called the PCA network (PCANet) and can be extremely easily and efficiently designed and learned. For comparison and to provide a better understanding, we also introduce and study two simple variations of PCANet: 1) RandNet and 2) LDANet. They share the same topology as PCANet, but their cascaded filters are either randomly selected or learned from linear discriminant analysis. We have extensively tested these basic networks on many benchmark visual data sets for different tasks, including Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) for face verification; the MultiPIE, Extended Yale B, AR, Facial Recognition Technology (FERET) data sets for face recognition; and MNIST for hand-written digit recognition. Surprisingly, for all tasks, such a seemingly naive PCANet model is on par with the state-of-the-art features either prefixed, highly hand-crafted, or carefully learned [by deep neural networks (DNNs)]. Even more surprisingly, the model sets new records for many classification tasks on the Extended Yale B, AR, and FERET data sets and on MNIST variations. Additional experiments on other public data sets also demonstrate the potential of PCANet to serve as a simple but highly competitive baseline for texture classification and object recognition.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2015.2475625","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7234886","Convolution Neural Network;Convolution neural network;Deep Learning;Face Recognition;Handwritten Digit Recognition;LDA Network;LDA network;Object Classification;PCA Network;PCA network;Random Network;deep learning;face recognition;handwritten digit recognition;object classification;random network","Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Histograms;Machine learning;Principal component analysis;Training","channel bank filters;face recognition;handwriting recognition;image classification;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object recognition;principal component analysis","AR;DNN;FERET data sets;LDANet;LFW;MNIST;PCA network;PCANet;RandNet;binary hashing;blockwise histograms;cascaded principal component analysis;data processing components;deep learning baseline;deep neural networks;extended Yale B;face verification;facial recognition technology;handwritten digit recognition;image classification;labeled faces;linear discriminant analysis;multiPIE;multistage filter banks;object recognition;public data sets;texture classification;visual data sets;wild","","31","","65","","20150901","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our model is learned under three constraints at the top layer of the deep network: 1) the loss between the original real-valued feature descriptor and the learned binary vector is minimized, 2) the binary codes distribute evenly on each bit, and 3) different bits are as independent as possible. To further improve the discriminative power of the learned binary codes, we extend DH into supervised DH (SDH) by including one discriminative term into the objective function of DH which simultaneously maximizes the inter-class variations and minimizes the intra-class variations of the learned binary codes.

Most of the machine learning algorithms rely on certain distance metrics that can only be applied to numeric data. This becomes a problem in complex datasets that contain heterogeneous data consisted of numeric and nominal (i.e. categorical) features. Thus the need of transformation from nominal to numeric data. Weight of evidence (WoE) is one of the parameters that can be used for transformation of the nominal features to numeric. In this paper we describe a method that uses WoE to transform the features. Although the applicability of this method is researched to some extent, in this paper we extend its applicability for multi-class problems, which is a novelty. We compared it with the method that generates dummy features. We test both methods on binary and multi-class classification problems with different machine learning algorithms. Our experiments show that the WoE based transformation generates smaller number of features compared to the technique based on generation of dummy features while also improving the classification accuracy, reducing memory complexity and shortening the execution time. Be that as it may, we also point out some of its weaknesses and make some recommendations when to use the method based on dummy features generation instead.","","Electronic:978-8-3608-1065-1; POD:978-1-4799-6747-6; USB:978-8-3608-1067-5","10.15439/2015F90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321439","Weight of Evidence;WoE;categorical features;data transformation;dummy features;heterogeneous data;nominal features","Accuracy;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement;Tin;Training;Transforms","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence)","WoE based transformation;categorical features;classification accuracy;complex datasets;dummy features;evidence parameter;execution time;heterogeneous data;machine learning algorithms;nominal features;numeric features;scientific community;supervised multiclass problems;weight of evidence","","","","31","","","13-16 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A potential concern when performing sentiment classification is that the training data may contain class imbalance, which can negatively affect classification performance. A classifier trained on imbalanced data may be biased in favor of the majority class. One possibile method of addressing this is to use data sampling to achieve a more balanced class distribution. In this work, we seek to observe how data sampling (using random undersampling with either a 50:50 or 35:65 positive:negative post-sampling class distribution ratio) affects the classification performance on tweet sentiment data. Our experimental results show that Random Undersampling significantly improves classification performance in comparison to not using any data sampling.

To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a new evolutionary method, EvoAE, to train auto encoders for deep learning networks. By evolving a population of auto encoders, EvoAE learns multiple features in each auto encoder in the form of hidden nodes, evaluates the auto encoders based on their reconstruction quality, and generates new auto encoders using crossover and mutation with chromosomes made up of hidden nodes and associated connections and weights. EvoAE optimizes network weights and structures of auto encoders simultaneously and employs a mini-batch variant, called Evo-batch, to speed up auto encoder search on large datasets. Furthermore, EvoAE supports different training methods in data partitioning and selection, requires little manual intervention, and reduces overall training time drastically over traditional methods on large datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6564-2; POD:978-1-4673-6565-9","10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273701","autoencoder;deep learning;evolutionary algorithm;neural networks","Backpropagation;Machine learning;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Testing;Training","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence)","Evo-batch;EvoAE;autoencoder search;chromosomes;crossover;data partitioning;data selection;deep learning networks;evolutionary method;large datasets;machine learning applications;minibatch variant;mutation;network weights optimization;reconstruction quality;training methods","","2","","10","","","1-5 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of SVM is to find an optimal boundary -- also known as hyperplane -- which separates the samples (examples in a dataset) of different classes by a maximum margin. Usually, very few samples contribute to the definition of the boundary. However, existing parallel algorithms use the entire dataset for finding the boundary, which is sub-optimal for performance reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed memory algorithm to eliminate the samples which do not contribute to the boundary definition in SVM. We propose several heuristics, which range from early (aggressive) to late (conservative) elimination of the samples, such that the overall time for generating the boundary is reduced considerably. In a few cases, a sample may be eliminated (shrunk) pre-emptively -- potentially resulting in an incorrect boundary. We propose a scalable approach to synchronize the necessary data structures such that the proposed algorithm maintains its accuracy. We consider the necessary trade-offs of single/multiple synchronization using in-depth time-space complexity analysis. We implement the proposed algorithm using MPI and compare it with libsvm -- de facto sequential SVM software -- which we enhance with OpenMP for multi-core/many-core parallelism.

Recent studies have shown that reviews written by the users represent a rich source of information for the app vendors and the developers, as they include information about bugs, ideas for new features, or documentation of released features. This paper introduces several probabilistic techniques to classify app reviews into four types: bug reports, feature requests, user experiences, and ratings. For this we use review metadata such as the star rating and the tense, as well as, text classification, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis techniques. We conducted a series of experiments to compare the accuracy of the techniques and compared them with simple string matching. We found that metadata alone results in a poor classification accuracy. When combined with natural language processing, the classification precision got between 70-95% while the recall between 80-90%. Multiple binary classifiers outperformed single multiclass classifiers.

A common line of research argues that authentic and manipulative reviews are distinguishable based on three textual characteristics, namely, comprehensibility, informativeness and writing style. Although recent studies have analyzed differences between authentic and manipulative reviews in terms of these textual characteristics, they often lack in terms of methodological rigor. For one, datasets used for analysis are not always representative. Moreover, only few machine learning algorithms are used to classify authentic and manipulative reviews. Recognizing the value of methodological rigor, this paper extends prior studies by examining textual differences between authentic and manipulative reviews using a more representative dataset. Moreover, authentic and manipulative reviews were classified using a voting among multiple classifiers that had been used in recent literature.

The multi-modal, often also high- dimensional , features may contain redundant and irrelevant information that can deteriorate the performance of modeling in classification. It is a challenging problem to select the informative features for a given task from the redundant and heterogeneous feature groups. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to address this problem. This framework is composed of two modules, namely, multi-modal deep neural networks and feature selection with sparse group LASSO. Given diverse groups of discriminative features, the proposed technique first converts the multi-modal data into a unified representation with different branches of the multi-modal deep neural networks. Then, through solving a sparse group LASSO problem, the feature selection component is used to derive a weight vector to indicate the importance of the feature groups. Finally, the feature groups with large weights are considered more relevant and hence are selected. We evaluate our framework on three image classification datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in selecting the relevant feature groups and achieves competitive classification performance as compared with several recent baseline methods.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2015.2477058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244241","Deep learning;feature selection;heterogeneous data;multi-modal;sparse representation","Data mining;Feature extraction;Kernel;Machine learning;Multimedia communication;Neural networks","","","","0","","55","","20150907","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thus a big challenge and area of research emerges in front of both the medical practitioner and scientific researcher to fight against cancers. When a patient is suspected for the presence of malignant tumor they are advised for FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) test where specimens of cells can be taken in minimally invasive way with, e.g., tiny needles, with or without syringes. One of the main drawbacks of cytopathological diagnosis is the time required for an expert to visually inspect a specimen under a microscope, in search of malignant or suspicious cells and manually select them for further analysis. The present work tried to device an automated computer-aided diagnostic system specifically to reduce time and provide `second opinion' for pathologists in making diagnosis. A database of 100 FNAC images were taken on which k-fold cross-validation was performed, where k varied, for the diagnosis of malignancy. Initially, elimination of cytoplasm from the images consisting of multiple cells was done by performing saturation threshold segmentation and from the segmented nucleus boundary, meaningful texture and shape describing features are calculated using GLCM and LBP algorithms. The outcome of segmentation followed by feature extraction was tested by using the Logistic classifier which is a machine learning algorithm. The achieved diagnostic accuracy is 86%, when features obtained by combining GLCM and LBP methods, are used for classification.","","DVD:978-1-4799-8348-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-8349-0; POD:978-1-4799-8350-6","10.1109/ReTIS.2015.7232886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232886","Benign-malignant-fine needle aspiration cytology-GLCM-LBP-Logistic classifier","Cancer;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Logistics;Machine learning algorithms","cancer;cellular biophysics;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;tumours","FNAC images;GLCM algorithms;LBP algorithms;automated computer-aided diagnostic system;automatic tumor identification;benign tumor;cancer;cytopathological diagnosis;cytoplasm elimination;feature extraction;fine needle aspiration cytology;logistic classifier;machine learning algorithm;malignant tumor;saturation threshold segmentation;segmented nucleus boundary;texture based approach","","0","","11","","","9-11 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is the chemical modification of a protein after its translation. It is a common biological mechanism for regulating protein localization, function, cellular communication, and turnover. The function of a modified protein is often strongly affected by these modifications. Thus increased knowledge about the glycosylation of a target protein may increase our understanding of the molecular processes in these proteins. Many methods for predicting glycosylation sites in protein sequences have been developed. Finding effective meta-prediction strategies that integrate different kinds of glycosylation sites predictors to achieve higher prediction performance is highly required. In this paper, we use the framework of multiplicative update algorithms in on-line decision problem to obtain more accurate meta-predictors. The experimental results show that performances of our meta-predictor are better than Oglyc, DictyOGlyc, YinOYan, NetOGlyc, GlycoEP in O-glycosylation sites prediction.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6926-5; POD:978-1-4799-6927-2","10.1109/CIBCB.2015.7300325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7300325","glycosylation;meta-predictor;multiplicative update algorithms;on-line decision problem","Diseases;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Protein engineering;Proteins;Tin;Training","biochemistry;bioinformatics;molecular biophysics;proteins","DictyOGlyc;GlycoEP;NetOGlyc;O-glycosylation sites prediction;Oglyc;YinOYan;metaprediction approach;on-line decision problem;post translational modifications;protein cellular communication;protein chemical modification;protein function;protein localization;protein turnover","","","","24","","","12-15 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they treat pedestrian detection as a single binary classification task, which may confuse positive with hard negative samples (Fig.1 (a)). To address this ambiguity, this work jointly optimize pedestrian detection with semantic tasks, including pedestrian attributes (e.g. `carrying backpack') and scene attributes (e.g. `vehicle', `tree', and `horizontal'). Rather than expensively annotating scene attributes, we transfer attributes information from existing scene segmentation datasets to the pedestrian dataset, by proposing a novel deep model to learn high-level features from multiple tasks and multiple data sources. Since distinct tasks have distinct convergence rates and data from different datasets have different distributions, a multi-task deep model is carefully designed to coordinate tasks and reduce discrepancies among datasets. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the challenging Caltech [9] and ETH [10] datasets where it reduces the miss rates of previous deep models by 17 and 5.5 percent, respectively.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4673-6964-0; POD:978-1-4673-6965-7; USB:978-1-4673-6963-3","10.1109/CVPR.2015.7299143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299143","","Barium;Data models;Detectors;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Semantics;Vehicles","feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pedestrians","binary classification task;deep learning method;feature learning;pedestrian detection optimization","","17","","37","","","7-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security information is potential to be mined from it. We can use data mining with some cloud computing platform for malware detection because the data volume is huge. The online education institutions need to virtualize their data centers and build cloud infrastructure for better using resources. So they should move data centers from physical machines(PMs) to virtual machines(VMs) for implementing the virtualization. But there are some risks such as the loss of computing ability, performance decline and so on. In this paper, we do a series of experiments to test performance of data mining algorithm based on Hadoop in physical machines and virtual machines. Through these experiments, we find that the performance of data mining algorithm based on Hadoop depends on disk I/O performance of Hadoop. The disk I/O performance of Hadoop deployed in PMs is better than that in VMs. Some iterative algorithms like k-means need more disk I/O, so we don't advise using VMs for computing. Other basic algorithms like Bayes classification need less disk I/O, so we advise computing in the VMs.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8872-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-8873-0; POD:978-1-4799-8874-7","10.1109/IMIS.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284964","Cloud computing;Hadoop;Online education;Performance comparison;data mining","Classification algorithms;Cloud computing;Data mining;Education;Machine learning algorithms;Malware;Virtual machining","Bayes methods;cloud computing;computer centres;data handling;data mining;educational computing;invasive software;iterative methods;parallel processing;telecommunication traffic","Bayes classification;Hadoop;PM;VM;cloud computing;cloud infrastructure;data centers;data mining algorithm;education data traffic volume;educational network;iterative algorithms;k-means;malware detection;mining packets;online education institutions;physical machines;virtual machines","","1","","21","","","8-10 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These techniques can be used to predict classes that are more likely to be buggy based on past history of buggy classes. These techniques work well as long as a sufficient amount of data is available to train a prediction model. However, there is rarely enough training data for new software projects. To deal with this problem, cross-project defect prediction, which transfers a prediction model trained using data from one project to another, has been proposed and is regarded as a new challenge for defect prediction. So far, only a few cross-project defect prediction techniques have been proposed. To advance the state-of-the-art, in this work, we investigate 7 composite algorithms, which integrate multiple machine learning classifiers, to improve cross-project defect prediction. To evaluate the performance of the composite algorithms, we perform experiments on 10 open source software systems from the PROMISE repository which contain a total of 5,305 instances labeled as defective or clean. We compare the composite algorithms with CODEP Logistic, which is the latest cross-project defect prediction algorithm proposed by Panichella et al., in terms of two standard evaluation metrics: cost effectiveness and F-measure. Our experiment results show that several algorithms outperform CODEP Logistic: Max performs the best in terms of F-measure and its average F-measure outperforms that of CODEP Logistic by 36.88%.

While rather than using the networks as a blackbox feature extractor, we customize the training strategy by partitioning contour (positive) data into subclasses and fitting each subclass by different model parameters. A new loss function, named positive-sharing loss, in which each subclass shares the loss for the whole positive class, is proposed to learn the parameters. Compared to the sofmax loss function, the proposed one, introduces an extra regularizer to emphasizes the losses for the positive and negative classes, which facilitates to explore more discriminative features.

However, wind speed prediction is extremely complex and difficult due to the volatility and deviation of the wind. As existing forecasting methods directly model the raw wind speed data, it is difficult for them to provide higher inference accuracy. Differently, this paper presents a sophisticated deep-learning technique for short-term and long-term wind speed forecast, i.e., the predictive deep Boltzmann machine (PDBM) and corresponding learning algorithm. The proposed deep model forecasts wind speed by analyzing the higher level features abstracted from lower level features of the wind speed data. These automatically learnt features are very informative and appropriate for the prediction. The proposed PDBM is a deep stochastic model that can represent the wind speed very well, and is inspired by two aspects. 1) The stochastic model is suitable to capture the probabilistic characteristics of wind speed. 2) Recent developments in neural networks with deep architectures show that deep generative models have competitive capability to approximate nonlinear and nonsmooth functions. The evaluation of the proposed PDBM model is depicted by both hour-ahead and day-ahead prediction experiments based on real wind speed datasets.

Our designed A-Wristocracy system improves upon the state-of-the-art works on in-home activity recognition using wearables. These works are mostly able to detect coarse-grained ADLs (Activities of Daily Living) but not large number of fine-grained and complex IADLs (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living). These are also not able to distinguish similar activities but with different context (such as sit on floor vs. sit on bed vs. sit on sofa). Our solution helps accurate detection of in-home ADLs/ IADLs and contextual activities, which are all critically important for remote elderly care in tracking their physical and cognitive capabilities. A-Wristocracy makes it feasible to classify large number of fine-grained and complex activities, through Deep Learning based data analytics and exploiting multi-modal sensing on wrist-worn device. It exploits minimal functionality from very light additional infrastructure (through only few Bluetooth beacons), for coarse level location context. A-Wristocracy preserves direct user privacy by excluding camera/ video imaging on wearable or infrastructure. The classification procedure consists of practical feature set extraction from multi-modal wearable sensor suites, followed by Deep Learning based supervised fine-level classification algorithm. We have collected exhaustive home-based ADLs and IADLs data from multiple users. Our designed classifier is validated to be able to recognize very fine-grained complex 22 daily activities (much larger number than 6-12 activities detected by state-of-the-art works using wearable and no camera/ video) with high average test accuracies of 90% or more for two users in two different home environments.","2376-8886;23768886","Electronic:978-1-4673-7201-5; POD:978-1-4673-7202-2","10.1109/BSN.2015.7299406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299406","","Accelerometers;Accuracy;Biomedical monitoring;Bluetooth;Context;Machine learning;Sensors","biomechanics;body sensor networks;geriatrics;patient care;telemedicine","A-Wristocracy system;Bluetooth;camera- video imaging;cognitive capability;data analytics;home environment;home-based IADL data;inhome ADL- IADL detection;inhome activity recognition;inhome user activity;multimodal wearable sensor suite;physical capability;remote elderly care;supervised fine-level classification algorithm;user complex activity recognition;user privacy;wrist-worn device sensing","","","","17","","","9-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A known issue for high-resolution sonars in littoral environments, is the occurence of high false alarm rates. Increased false alarm rates increase the workload of sonar operators and also reduces the usefullness of automatic systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles, since their limited communication abilities hinder them from sharing large amounts of contacts. The false alarm rate may be reduced simply by increasing the threshold used in the detection process. However, this also reduces the probability of detecting actual targets. Automatic classification algorithms provide more sophisticated alternatives for false alarm reduction. The work presented here demonstrates an automatic classification algorithm on a data set collected in a littoral environment. The data set contains a large amount of false alarms, particularly close to the coast, but does not contain any submarine target detections. Synthetic submarine echoes are therefore added to the sonar data set. Six features are extracted from the hybrid synthetic-recorded data set. The features are fed into supervised machine learning schemes. The performance of each scheme is presented as receiver operating characteristic curves.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8736-8; POD:978-1-4799-8737-5","10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7271508","","Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Signal to noise ratio;Sonar;Training;Underwater vehicles","autonomous underwater vehicles;echo suppression;electronic warfare;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;sensitivity analysis;signal classification;sonar detection;sonar signal processing;synthetic aperture sonar","ASW classification algorithm;antisubmarine warfare sonar;false alarm rate;false alarm reduction;hybrid recorded synthetic sonar data set;littoral environment;receiver operating characteristic curve;spatial resolution maximisation;submarine target detection;supervised machine learning scheme;synthetic submarine echo","","1","","24","","","18-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we discuss how a parallel implementation of the algorithm for computing the information gain can address these issues. Our approach is based on writing Pig Latin scripts that are compiled into MapReduce jobs which then can be executed on Hadoop clusters. In order to implement the algorithm first we define a framework for developing arbitrary algorithms and then we apply it for the task at hand. With intent to analyze the impact of the parallelization, we have processed the FedCSIS AAIA'14 dataset with the proposed implementation of the information gain. During the experiments we evaluate the speedup of the parallelization compared to a one-node cluster. We also analyze how to optimally determine the number of map and reduce tasks for a given cluster. To demonstrate the portability of the implementation we present results using an on-premises and Amazon AWS clusters. Finally, we illustrate the scalability of the implementation by evaluating it on a replicated version of the same dataset which is 80 times larger than the original.","","Electronic:978-8-3608-1065-1; POD:978-1-4799-6747-6; USB:978-8-3608-1067-5","10.15439/2015F89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321440","Hadoop;MapReduce;feature ranking;information gain;parallelization","Entropy;Loading;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Parallel processing;Servers;Writing","Big Data;information dissemination;parallel processing","Amazon AWS cluster;Big data;FedCSIS AAIA'14 dataset;Hadoop;MapReduce;Pig Latin script;information gain;parallel computation","","1","","46","","","13-16 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose constrained feature selection algorithms that we use to localize faults. Feature selection algorithms are commonly used to identify important features that are helpful for a classification task. By mapping an execution trace to a classification instance and a program element to a feature, we can transform fault localization to the feature selection problem. Unfortunately, existing feature selection algorithms do not perform too well, and we extend its performance by adding a constraint to the feature selection formulation based on a specific characteristic of the fault localization problem. We have performed experiments on a popular benchmark containing 154 faulty versions from 8 programs and demonstrate that several variants of our approach can outperform many fault localization techniques proposed in the literature.

Schizophrenia is a severe neurological disorder which has been characterized by varying symptoms namely hallucinations, delusions and cognitive problems. In this paper, we have investigated the resting state fMRI images of 15 normal controls and 12 Schizophrenia patients by constructing functional connectome through image preprocessing techniques namely Realignment, temporal correction, filtering, etc., The parcellation of neuroimage is performed based on Automated Anatomical Labelling (AAL) atlas and 74 regions of interest (ROI) are identified. Functional connectome of each subject includes Pearson correlation values of mean time courses obtained between the regions. These region to region functional connectivity is considered as features and the feature selection technique namely Fisher filtering, ReliefF filtering and Runs filtering are applied. Then the features which are found by different filtering techniques are fed as input to the supervised non linear classifiers namely Random forest, C4.5, Cost sensitive classification and regression tree and K-Nearest Neighbour classification algorithm. These algorithms have produced classification rules which are used in the prediction of Schizophrenia disorder. C4.5 has achieved the higher predictive accuracy of 93% with leave-one out cross-validation and the predominant feature or diagnostic biomarker is obtained from the rule. This feature is one among the commonly identified feature of different feature selection techniques. The work has shown that the biomarker corresponds to the alterations in the functional connectivity between the brain regions namely Rolandic operculum and Postcentral gyrus of brain's left hemisphere which is involved in sensorimotor function of human.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3975-6; POD:978-1-4799-3976-3","10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238525","Classification;Feature selection;Functional connectivity;Resting state fMRI;Schizophrenia","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Filtering;Filtering algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Vegetation","biomedical MRI;data mining;diseases;filtering theory;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;regression analysis;trees (mathematics)","AAL atlas;C4.5;Fisher filtering;Pearson correlation;Postcentral gyrus;ReliefF filtering;Rolandic operculum;Runs filtering;Schizophrenia disorder;automated anatomical labelling;cost sensitive classification;data mining technique;diagnostic biomarker identification;functional connectivity;image preprocessing technique;k-nearest neighbour classification algorithm;neurological disorder;random forest;regions of interest;regression tree;state fMRI images;supervised nonlinear classifiers","","0","","41","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a general CNN-based multi-modal learning framework for RGB-D object recognition. We first construct deep CNN layers for color and depth separately, which are then connected with a carefully designed multi-modal layer. This layer is designed to not only discover the most discriminative features for each modality, but is also able to harness the complementary relationship between the two modalities. The results of the multi-modal layer are back-propagated to update parameters of the CNN layers, and the multi-modal feature learning and the back-propagation are iteratively performed until convergence.

The efforts towards achieving a common platform for AU evaluation have been addressed in the FG 2015 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2015). Participants are invited to estimate AU occurrence and intensity on a common benchmark dataset. Conventional approaches towards achieving automated methods are to train multiclass classifiers or to use regression models. In this paper, we propose a novel application of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize AUs as part of FERA 2015 challenge. The 7 layer network is composed of 3 convolutional layers and a max-pooling layer. The final fully connected layers provide the classification output. For the selected tasks of the challenge, we have trained two different networks for the two different datasets, where one focuses on the AU occurrences and the other on both occurrences and intensities of the AUs. The occurrence and intensity of AU activation are estimated using specific neuron activations of the output layer. This way, we are able to create a single network architecture that could simultaneously be trained to produce binary and continuous classification output.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6026-2; POD:978-1-4799-6027-9","10.1109/FG.2015.7284873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284873","","Conferences;Estimation;Face;Face recognition;Gold;Machine learning;Training","emotion recognition;face recognition;image classification;neural nets;regression analysis","AU occurrence estimation;CNN;FACS AU activation;FACS action unit occurrence;FG 2015 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge;binary classification output;continuous classification output;convolutional layers;deep convolutional neural network;deep learning;ground truth annotation;intensity estimation;max-pooling layer;multiclass classifiers;neuron activations;regression models;single network architecture","","5","","21","","","4-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Subsequently, it simplifies the problem the RL agent is addressing, creating a more stable system. The Episodic Natural Actor Critic (ENAC) RL algorithm is used due to the continuous input and output domains and for the natural actor critic's convergence properties. Adaptiveness of the system is presented in a thruster failure scenario. RL is used in this failure scenario to learn an appropriate policy for the behaviours' weights under the new vehicle dynamics.

The hypothesis that simultaneous multiscale views can improve composition-based inference of classes containing size-varying objects compared to single-scale multiview is investigated. The end-to-end learning system learns a hierarchical feature representation with the aid of convolutional layers to shift the burden of feature determination from hand-engineering to a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). This allows the classifier to obtain problem-specific features that are optimal for minimizing the multinomial logistic regression objective, as opposed to user-defined features which trade optimality for generality. A heuristic approach to the optimization of the DCNN hyperparameters is used, based on empirical performance evidence. It is shown that a single DCNN can be trained simultaneously with multiscale views to improve prediction accuracy over multiple single-scale views. Competitive performance is achieved for the UC Merced data set, where the 93.48% accuracy of multiview deep learning outperforms the 85.37% accuracy of SIFT-based methods and the 90.26% accuracy of unsupervised feature learning.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2015.2483680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7307121","Feature extraction;neural network applications;neural network architecture;remote sensing;urban areas","Accuracy;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons;Remote sensing;Storage tanks;Training","geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;land use;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","DCNN hyperparameters optimization;Multiview Deep Learning;SIFT-based methods;UC Merced data set;composition-based in- ference;convolutional layers;deep convolutional neural network;end-to-end learning sys- tem;feature determination;hand-engineering;heuristic approach;hierarchical feature representation;multinomial logistic re- gression objective;multiple single-scale views;multiscale input strategy;problem-specific fea- tures;size-varying objects;supervised multispectral land-use classification;unsupervised feature learning;user-defined features;well-known data set","","9","","15","","20151026","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the features are usually designed artificially and may not be suitable for data from new-coming sensors. In this paper a novel loop closure detection approach is proposed that learns features from raw data using deep neural networks instead of common visual features.

In this paper, we propose a novel pose recovery method using non-linear mapping with multi-layered deep neural network. It is based on feature extraction with multimodal fusion and back-propagation deep learning. In multimodal fusion, we construct hypergraph Laplacian with low-rank representation. In this way, we obtain a unified feature description by standard eigen-decomposition of the hypergraph Laplacian matrix. In back-propagation deep learning, we learn a non-linear mapping from 2D images to 3D poses with parameter fine-tuning.

Moreover, these methods generally use application- specific hand-engineered and static feature models, which are not suitable for continuous learning. Some recent approaches on activity recognition use deep-learning-based hierarchical feature models, but the large size of these networks constrain them from being used in continuous learning scenarios. In this work, we propose a continuous activity learning framework for streaming videos by intricately tying together deep hybrid feature models and active learning. This allows us to automatically select the most suitable features and take the advantage of incoming unlabeled instances to improve the existing model incrementally. Given the segmented activities from streaming videos, we learn features in an unsupervised manner using deep hybrid networks, which have the ability to take the advantage of both the local hand-engineered features and the deep model in an efficient way. Additionally, we use active learning to train the activity classifier using a reduced amount of manually labeled instances. Retraining the models with a huge amount of accumulated examples is computationally expensive and not suitable for continuous learning. Hence, we propose a method to select the best subset of these examples to update the models incrementally.

Change-level defect prediction, which is also referred as just-in-time defect prediction, could not only ensure software quality in the development process, but also make the developers check and fix the defects in time. Nowadays, deep learning is a hot topic in the machine learning literature. Whether deep learning can be used to improve the performance of just-in-time defect prediction is still uninvestigated. In this paper, to bridge this research gap, we propose an approach Deeper which leverages deep learning techniques to predict defect-prone changes. We first build a set of expressive features from a set of initial change features by leveraging a deep belief network algorithm. Next, a machine learning classifier is built on the selected features. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we use datasets from six large open source projects, i.e., Bugzilla, Columba, JDT, Platform, Mozilla, and PostgreSQL, containing a total of 137,417 changes. We compare our approach with the approach proposed by Kamei et al. The experimental results show that on average across the 6 projects, Deeper could discover 32.22% more bugs than Kamei et al's approach (51.04% versus 18.82% on average). In addition, Deeper can achieve F1-scores of 0.22-0.63, which are statistically significantly higher than those of Kamei et al.'s approach on 4 out of the 6 projects.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7989-2; POD:978-1-4673-7990-8","10.1109/QRS.2015.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272910","Cost Effectiveness;Deep Belief Network;Deep Learning;Just-In-Time Defect Prediction","Computer bugs;Feature extraction;Logistics;Machine learning;Measurement;Software quality;Training","just-in-time;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;software quality","change-level defect prediction;deep learning;just-in-time defect prediction;machine learning classifier;machine learning literature;software quality","","2","","40","","","3-5 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper is a kind of improvement aimed at the shortcoming of K-means++ algorithm, which introduces the concept of the variance in probability and mathematical statistics. Variance reflects the degree of density between samples and other samples. In the K-means++ algorithm when you select the first initial clustering center, you need to select minimum variance of sample points, which is in the position of the largest sample density, then you select the next cluster centers based on the weight method of D<sup>2</sup> which is described in the K-means++ algorithm.

Our idea is that when the data labels are available, binary codes can be learned by employing a hidden layer for representing the latent concepts that dominate the class labels. The utilization of the CNN also allows for learning image representations. Unlike other supervised methods that require pair-wised inputs for binary code learning, our method learns hash codes and image representations in a point-wised manner, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing algorithms on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.

Facing with the huge database in all kinds of fields, it is more and more difficult to cope with the big data only by using conventional technology. New technique to deal with these data at a high level is eagerly demanded. Therefore, the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Database) technology arises at the historic moment. KDD is an integrated process, which includes data input, iterative solving, user interface and many other custom requirements and design decisions, where the data mining (DM) is a key and specific step in KDD.

In comparison with generic object recognition, fine-grained image classification (FGIC) is much more challenging because (i) fine-grained labeled data is much more expensive to acquire (usually requiring domain expertise); (ii) there exists large intra-class and small inter-class variance. Most recent work exploiting deep CNN for image recognition with small training data adopts a simple strategy: pre-train a deep CNN on a large-scale external dataset (e.g., ImageNet) and fine-tune on the small-scale target data to fit the specific classification task. In this paper, beyond the fine-tuning strategy, we propose a systematic framework of learning a deep CNN that addresses the challenges from two new perspectives: (i) identifying easily annotated hyper-classes inherent in the fine-grained data and acquiring a large number of hyper-class-labeled images from readily available external sources (e.g., image search engines), and formulating the problem into multitask learning; (ii) a novel learning model by exploiting a regularization between the fine-grained recognition model and the hyper-class recognition model. We demonstrate the success of the proposed framework on two small-scale fine-grained datasets (Stanford Dogs and Stanford Cars) and on a large-scale car dataset that we collected.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4673-6964-0; POD:978-1-4673-6965-7; USB:978-1-4673-6963-3","10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298880","","Feature extraction;Image recognition;Machine learning;Neural networks;Search engines;Solid modeling;Visualization","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence)","FGIC;Stanford Cars;Stanford Dogs;deep CNN;deep convolutional neural networks;fine-grained image classification;fine-grained labeled data;fine-grained recognition model;fine-tuning strategy;hyper-class augmented deep learning;hyper-class recognition model;hyper-class-labeled images;image recognition;large intra-class variance;large-scale external dataset;large-scale generic object recognition;learning model;multitask learning;regularized deep learning;small inter-class variance;small-scale fine-grained datasets","","7","","43","","","7-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
