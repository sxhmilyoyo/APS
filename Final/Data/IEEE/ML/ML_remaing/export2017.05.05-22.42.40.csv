Supporting simultaneous voice and data services in a cellular network is not only desirable but also becoming indispensable. However, if the voice and data are serviced through the same antenna (like the 3G UMTS network), a voice call with data sessions requires better radio connection than a voice-only call. In this paper, we systematically study the coordination between the voice and data transmissions in UMTS networks. From analyzing a large carrier's UMTS network recording data, we first identify the most relevant network measurements/features indicating a potential call drop, then propose a drop-call predictor based on AdaBoost. Moreover, we develop an intelligent call management strategy to voluntarily block data sessions when the voice is predicted to be dropped. Our analysis utilizing real service provider's data sets shows that our proposed scheme can not only predict drop calls with a very high accuracy but also achieve the highest user satisfaction compared to the other existing call management strategies.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4673-5946-7; POD:978-1-4673-5944-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6566808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566808","","3G mobile communication;Data communication;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement;Member and Geographic Activities Board committees;Prediction algorithms","3G mobile communication;antennas;data communication;smart phones;voice communication","3G UMTS network;AdaBoost;antenna;cell phones;cellular network;data services;data transmissions;drop-call predictor;intelligent call management;proactive call drop avoidance;smart phones;user satisfaction;voice services;voice transmissions","","3","","15","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we describe a method by which activity discovery can be used to identify behavioral patterns in observational data. Discovering patterns in the data that does not belong to a predefined class aids in understanding this data and segmenting it into learnable classes.

The socket hook can capture the packets and gain the related information of the captured packet and send the gained information to the memory.

These selected columns are supposed to hold the salient features expressing the data. A very common ID approach in the literature is based on importance sampling where a statistical leverage score is computed for each column and K columns are randomly selected using these scores. These randomized methods aim a better low-rank approximation of the matrix by seeking for the columns that express the range of the matrix the best. This makes ID a good alternative to Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) since it favors sparsity and the bases correspond to real data points. However, the columns leading to the best low-rank approximation are usually not the ones in terms of representativeness if the underlying data is composed of several clusters which is very common in real life. In this paper, we introduce an alternative ID approach based on clustering. We employ K-medoids to be employed as an ID method for better interpretability and respresentativeness. We apply ID on handwritten digit recognition and supply comparative results of the proposed approach to the state-of-the-art method in the literature. We show its superiority in terms of representativeness of the data.

There is a set of constraints among the variables that restrict the different values they can take simultaneously. The task is to find one assignment to all the variables without breaking any constraint. To solve a CSP instance, a search tree is created where each node represents a variable of the instance. The order in which the variables are selected for instantiation changes the form of the search tree and affects the cost of finding a solution. Many heuristics have been proposed to help to decide the next variable to instantiate during the search and they have proved to be helpful for some instances. In this paper we explore the use of learning classifier systems to construct selective hyper-heuristics that dynamically select, from a set of variable ordering heuristics for CSPs, the one that best matches the current problem state in order to perform well on a wide range of instances. During a training phase, the system constructs state-heuristic rules as it explores the search space. Heuristics with good performance at certain points are rewarded and become more likely to be applied in similar situations. The approach is tested on random instances, providing promising results with respect to the median performance of the variable ordering heuristics used in isolation.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0454-9; POD:978-1-4799-0453-2","10.1109/CEC.2013.6557885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557885","","Genetic algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Testing;Training","constraint satisfaction problems;heuristic programming;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CSP instance;constraint satisfaction problem;learning classifier system;selective hyper-heuristic design;state-heuristic rule;variable ordering heuristics","","1","","42","","","20-23 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper, utilizing statistical method and linguistics knowledge, carries out the work of crawling, parsing, filling, builds the relational formal concept lattice with Chinese entities context, and acquires entity relationship schemas described by relational formal concept. With these relational schemas and concept built above, we carry out the entry concept correlation computing and the predicate text flexible matching, and get the concept connectivity distance between entities to achieve the non-single and indirect entity relation extraction. The granularities of concept in relation extraction are more flexible, and the relational schema described by formal concept is more versatile and robust.

The results show that curriculum learning can help increase the performance of a classifying perceptron system, and with the ranking perceptron, it is possible achieve similar system performance with a shorter training time.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5563-6; POD:978-1-4673-5562-9","10.1109/SIU.2013.6531443","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6531443","Curriculum Learning;Discriminative Language Modeling;Perceptron","Automatic speech recognition;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning algorithms;Speech;Speech processing;Training","languages;linguistics;pattern classification;pattern clustering;perceptrons","automatic speech recognition error correction;curriculum-based discriminative language model training;perceptron ranking;perceptron system classifying performance improvement;training example clustering;training example ordering;training example selection;training time","","0","","11","","","24-26 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing number of services available within an enterprise and over the Internet, locating a service online may not be appropriate from the performance perspective, especially in large Internet-based service repositories. Instead, services usually need to be clustered according to their similarity. Thereafter, services in one or several clusters are necessary to be examined online during dynamic service discovery. In this paper, we propose to cluster data providing (DP) services using a refined fuzzy C-means algorithm. We consider the composite relation between DP service elements (i.e., input, output, and semantic relation between them) when representing DP services in terms of vectors. A DP service vector is assigned to one or multiple clusters with certain degrees. In addition, we introduce some operations for managing service clusters, when new services emerge or existing services disappear or become unavailable. When grouping similar services into one cluster, while partitioning different services into different clusters, the capability of service search engine is improved significantly.

Most of existing approaches apply machine learning algorithms where the link prediction problem is converted into a binary classification task. In this work, we propose a new dyadic topological link prediction approach applying supervised social choice algorithm. Given a training graph observed over a period [t<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>0</sub>'], this interval is divided into two sub-intervals: the learning interval and the labeling one. For each unlinked couple of vertices in the learning interval, a topological feature vector is computed. The labeling interval is used to fix the class of each example (e.g. linking, not-linking). Instead of learning a classification model as it is the case when applying machine learning approaches, we use these data to learn weights to associate to each computed feature based on the ability of each attribute to predict observed links. These weights are then used within weighted/supervised computational social choice algorithms to predict new links at time t > t<sub>0</sub>'. Two weighting schemes are experimented. We introduce weighted social choice rules by modifying classical voting approaches, namely: the Borda rule and the Kemeny aggregation rule. We also introduce our own concept of finding weights.

Given labeled data, algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) or projection methods such as Fisher discriminant analysis may be executed in the feature space. For unsupervised dimensionality reduction in the feature space, the most common approach is to perform principal component analysis (PCA) in that space, thus maximally capturing the variability of the feature space data, however, doing so without necessarily capturing any cluster structure in the data. In this tutorial, we review the theory behind feature space mapping and review recent advances that broaden the understanding and interpretability of the mapping in terms of a key input space quantity, particularly the quadratic Renyi entropy of the data via the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a psd convolution operator.

It is well-known that most successful machine learning algorithms are based on stationary data i.e., data that are assumed to have a fixed distribution (although unknown, in most cases). Non-stationary classification problems require the induced classifiers to be flexible enough to learn or adapt themselves to reflect the changes on data distribution over time; this can be a hard task, taking into account that changes that may happen are not usually known in advance. Although there are several proposals in the literature that deal with non-stationary data, none of them deal with missing attribute values, a common problem in real applications. This paper proposes an ensemble of classifiers for non-stationary environments that (1) uses a new graph structure for representing data known as Complete P-partite Attribute-based Decision Graph - CPp-AbDG; (2) handles data described by heterogeneous attributes (numeric and categorical) and (3) handles missing attribute values. Experiments in non-stationary environments show evidence of the strength of the CPp-AbDG representation as well as the potentiality of the proposed ensemble approach.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0454-9; POD:978-1-4799-0453-2","10.1109/CEC.2013.6557779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557779","Data graph construction;Ensemble learning;Graph-based learning;Missing attribute values;Non-stationary data classification","Classification algorithms;Equations;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Proposals;Training;Vectors","data handling;data structures;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CPp-AbDG representation;complete P-partite attribute-based decision graph;complete P-partite graph classifier ensemble;data distribution;data handling;data representation;graph structure;heterogeneous attributes;machine learning algorithms;missing attribute value handling;nonstationary classification problems;nonstationary data","","3","","36","","","20-23 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In Genetic Fuzzy Systems (GFSs), overfitting is usually avoided through the control of the number of rules and/or the number of labels. However, in many machine learning approaches, variance is reduced through the use of a validation set. Inspired by this idea, we propose in this paper an Instance Selection (IS) algorithm for regression problems called Class Conditional Instance Selection for Regression (CCISR) which is based on CCIS [1]. The output of CCISR is used in a GFS to obtain Rule Bases with a low variance, as the rules are generated with an ad hoc data driven method guided by the selected instances, but the error is still measured with the full training dataset. The combined system has been tested over 12 publicly available datasets, and results were compared with other GFSs.

Since different experts may have incompatible score distributions, score-level fusion requires careful considerations. We propose a novel solution to this problem with an error-rate-based fusion strategy, which relies on the false acceptance and false rejection rates of each individual expert to compute the overall confidence of the user verification.

We begin by formulating the sparse learning-to-rank problem as a convex optimization problem with a sparse-inducing ℓ<sub>1</sub> constraint. Since the ℓ<sub>1</sub> constraint is nondifferentiable, the critical issue arising here is how to efficiently solve the optimization problem. To address this issue, we propose a learning algorithm from the primal dual perspective. Furthermore, we prove that, after at most O(1/ε) iterations, the proposed algorithm can guarantee the obtainment of an ε-accurate solution. This convergence rate is better than that of the popular subgradient descent algorithm. i.e., O(1/ε<sup>2</sup>). Empirical evaluation on several public benchmark data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm: 1) Compared to the methods that learn dense models, learning a ranking model with sparsity constraints significantly improves the ranking accuracies. 2) Compared to other methods for sparse learning-to-rank, the proposed algorithm tends to obtain sparser models and has superior performance gain on both ranking accuracies and training time. 3) Compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, the ranking accuracies of the proposed algorithm are very competitive and stable.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2012.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165264","Fenchel duality;Learning-to-rank;ranking algorithm;sparse models","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines;Vectors","convex programming;gradient methods;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","convex optimization problem;dense model learning;information retrieval;learned ranking models;learning algorithm;nonzero coefficients;performance gain;primal-dual algorithm;ranking accuracy improvement;sparse learning-to-rank problem;sparse-inducing l<sub>1</sub> constraint;sparsity constraints;subgradient descent algorithm","","13","","34","","20120306","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in many applications, it is often possible to collect a small number of labeled samples. To effectively exploit this small number of labeled samples combined with a multitude of the unlabeled data, we present a novel semisupervised clustering technique [incremental and decremental affinity propagation (ID-AP)] that incorporates labeled exemplars into the AP algorithm. Unlike standard semisupervised clustering methods, the proposed technique improves the performance by using both the labeled samples to adjust the similarity matrix and an ID-learning principle for unlabeled data selection and useless labeled samples rejection, respectively. This avoids both learning-bias and stability-plasticity dilemma. In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed ID-AP technique, the experimental analysis was carried out on three different kinds of multispectral images including different percentages of labeled samples. In the analysis, we also studied the accuracy and the stability of two semisupervised clustering algorithms [i.e., constrained <i>k</i>-means and semisupervised AP (SAP)] and one incremental semisupervised clustering algorithm (i.e., incremental SAP). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ID-AP technique adequately captures and takes full advantage of the intrinsic relationship between the labeled samples and unlabeled data, and produces better performance than the other considered methods.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2206818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6276253","Affinity propagation (AP);decremental learning;incremental learning;multispectral images;semisupervised clustering","Algorithm design and analysis;Availability;Clustering algorithms;Labeling;Machine learning;Remote sensing;Training","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;pattern clustering","AP algorithm;ID-AP technique;ID-learning principle;decremental affinity propagation;incremental affinity propagation;labeled samples;land-cover identification;learning-bias dilemma;multispectral images;remote sensing images;semisupervised clustering algorithm;semisupervised clustering technique;stability-plasticity dilemma;unlabeled data","","8","","55","","20120821","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This interesting problem requires to recognize naturally human emotions which come from our mind but ignore the external expressions fully controlled by a subject. A popular approach uses key information from electroencephalography (EEG) signals to identify human emotions. In this paper, we proposed an emotion recognition model based on the Russell's circumplex model, Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. Moreover, we also proposed a method to determine an emotion label of a series of EEG signals. Our model includes two main approaches in machine learning step. In a first approach, machine learning was utilized for all EEG signals from numerous subjects while another used machine learning for each particular subject. We extensively implemented our model in several test data. The experimental results showed that the first approach is impossible to apply in practical applications because EEG signal of each subject has individual characteristic.

In order to evaluate the performance of Adaboost learning with a few examples, we simply apply Adaboost learning to a recently proposed feature descriptor - Locally Adaptive Regression Kernel (LARK). As a type of state-of-the-art feature descriptor, LARK is robust against illumination changes and noises. More importantly, we use LARK because its spatial property is also favorable for our purpose (i.e., each patch in the LARK descriptor corresponds to one unique pixel in the original image). In addition to learning a detector from the entire training dataset, we also split the original training dataset into several sub-groups and then we train one detector for each sub-group. We compare those features associated using the detector of each sub-group with that of the detector learnt with the entire training dataset and propose improvements based on the comparison results.

Geospatial data that exhibit time varying patterns are being captured faster than we are able to process them. We thus need machines to assist us in these tasks. One such problem is the automatic understanding of the behavior of moving objects for finding higher level information such as goals, intention etc. We propose a system that can solve one part of this complex task: automatic classification of movement patterns made by objects. In addition our system makes some simplifying assumptions: a) the object can be approximated as a moving point object (MPO) b) we consider interaction of a single MPO such as a car or mobile human, with static elements such as road networks and buildings e.g. airports, bus stops etc. on a terrain c) interactions between multiple MPOs are not considered. We use supervised machine learning algorithms to train the proposed system in classifying various patterns of spatiotemporal data. Algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree learning are trained with human labeled feature vectors that mathematically summarize how an MPO interacts with a landmark over time. Our feature vector incorporates a variety of geometric and temporal measurements such as the variable distances of the MPO to different points on the landmark, rate of change with time of variables such as distances and angles that are formed by the MPO with respect to the landmark. Simulated data created through graphical user interaction and agent-based modeling techniques are used to simulate MPO patterns over a representation of a real-world road network. The open source agent-based modeling tool Net Logo along with its GIS extension, and also the Agent Analyst module of ArcGIS are used to simulate large data sets. As future extensions, we are working on classification and prediction problems that involve multiple MPOs and landmarks.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5012-1; POD:978-1-4799-0301-6","10.1109/COMGEO.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6602064","","Computers;Data models;Educational institutions;Geospatial analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Roads;Support vector machine classification","decision trees;geographic information systems;graphical user interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;public domain software;support vector machines","ArcGIS;GIS extension;MPO;Net Logo;agent analyst module;agent based modeling techniques;automatic classification;decision tree learning;geospatial data;graphical user interaction;mobile human;moving point object characterization;road networks;spatiotemporal data pattern;supervised machine learning algorithms;support vector machines;time varying patterns","","0","","","","","22-24 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce a new approach of Boosting using decision tree for classifying noisy data. The proposed approach considers a series of decision tree classifiers and combines the votes of each classifier for classifying known or unknown instances. We update the weights of training instances based on the misclassification error rates that are produced by the training instances in each round of classifier construction.

Ant colony algorithm is used to select nodes while ants should visit all features. At the end of a tour, each ant has a binary vector with the same length as the number of features where 1 implies selecting and 0 implies deselecting the corresponding feature.

However, one of the premier data sources in astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), does not provide classification information for the 50 million galaxy images it contains. As there are simply too many objects to classify manually, machine learning and classification algorithms are required to automate this process. This research applies the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify galaxy morphologies. The accuracy of the classification is measured on various categories of galaxies from the survey. A three class algorithm is presented that makes use of multiple SVMs. This algorithm is used to assign the categories of spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5004-6; POD:978-1-4799-0300-9","10.1109/ICCIS.2013.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6643007","Classification;Data Mining;Galaxy Morphologies;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms;Morphology;Spirals;Support vector machines","Galaxy;astronomical image processing;data mining;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","SDSS;SVM algorithm;Sloan digital sky survey;astronomy;data sources;elliptical galaxies;galaxy image classification;galaxy morphology classification;irregular galaxies;machine learning;spiral galaxies;support vector machines;three class algorithm;universe","","1","","4","","","21-23 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several feature selection methods exist in the literature, each of them uses a specific feature evaluation criterion and may produce different feature subsets even when applied to the same data set. There is not a better resulting subset than the others but all the obtained subsets are the best subsets among the whole feature space. Thinking of a way to take advantage of different feature selection methods simultaneously is a challenging data mining problem. Recently, ensemble feature selection concept have been introduced to help solve this problem. Multiple feature selections are combined in order to produce more robust feature subsets and better classification results. However, one of the most critical decisions when performing ensemble feature selection is the aggregation technique to use for combining the resulting feature lists from the multiple algorithms into a single decision for each feature. In this paper, we propose a robust feature aggregation technique to combine the results of three different filter methods. Our aggregation technique is based on measuring feature algorithms confidence and conflict with the other ones in order to assign a reliability factor guiding the final feature selection. Experiments on high dimensional data sets show that the proposed approach outperforms the single feature selection algorithms as well as two well known aggregation methods in terms of classification performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0838-7; POD:978-1-4799-0835-6","10.1109/HPCSim.2013.6641406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641406","","Breast cancer;Data mining;Decision trees;Machine learning algorithms;Robustness;Support vector machines","data mining;pattern classification","aggregation technique;confidence measurement;conflict measurement;data mining problem;data preprocessing;feature subsets;filter methods;high dimensional data sets;reliability factor;robust ensemble feature selection","","6","","23","","","1-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose to take advantage of contextual information for predicting the stay time of mobile users. Specially, we investigate two strategies for modeling the relevance between it and contextual information, i.e., Stay Status Prediction (SSP) and Stay Time Prediction (STP). SSP is to predict whether a mobile user will stay at the current location at time point t<sub>i+n</sub> according to the contextual information at t<sub>i</sub>, while STP is to directly predict how long a mobile user will stay at the current location. Moreover, we study several typical machine learning models which can be extended for implementing SSP and STP and evaluate their performance with respect to prediction accuracy.

Besides, compared with traditional spatial verification based methods which measure image similarity only with single inlier's statistical properties, we bind close inlier visual words together to mine more geometric information from images.

This paper approaches this matter by reducing the time needed to create a detection model on very large databases and suggests three different optimization techniques. First, the perceptron algorithm was adjusted to use the map-reduce paradigm in order to make it run in a distribute manner. Second, hardware specific optimizations were applied for faster mathematical computations. Finally, a cache system was used to reduce the quantity of data processed by the algorithm.

We present challenges that need to be addressed for real-world deployment of robots capable of learning new visual objects in interaction with everyday users. We argue that in addition to robust machine learning and computer vision methods, well-designed interfaces are crucial for learning efficiency. In particular, we argue that interfaces can be key in helping nonexpert users to collect good learning examples and, thus, improve the performance of the overall learning system. Then, we present four alternative human-robot interfaces: Three are based on the use of a mediating artifact (smartphone, wiimote, wiimote and laser), and one is based on natural human gestures (with a Wizard-of-Oz recognition system). These interfaces mainly vary in the kind of feedback provided to the user, allowing him to understand more or less easily what the robot is perceiving and, thus, guide his way of providing training examples differently. We then evaluate the impact of these interfaces, in terms of learning efficiency, usability, and user's experience, through a real world and large-scale user study. In this experiment, we asked participants to teach a robot 12 different new visual objects in the context of a robotic game. This game happens in a home-like environment and was designed to motivate and engage users in an interaction where using the system was meaningful.

In particular, we show that interfaces such as the smartphone interface allows nonexpert users to intuitively provide much better training examples to the robot, which is almost as good as expert users who are trained for this task and are aware of the different visual perception and machine learning issues.

For human players, the most important thing in the game is to select the strategy in the early stage of the game. Also, it is important to recognize the opponent's strategy as quickly as possible. Because of the “fog-of-war” in the game, the player should send a scouting unit to opponent's hidden territory and the player predicts the types of strategy from the partially observed information. Usually, expert players are familiar with the relationships between two build orders and they can change the current build order if his choice is not strong to the opponent's strategy. However, players in AI competitions show quite different behaviors compared to the human leagues. For example, they usually have a pre-selected build order and rarely change their order during the game. In fact, the computer players have little interest in recognizing opponent's strategy and scouting units are used in a limited manner. The reason is that the implementation of scouting behavior and the change of build order from the scouting vision is not a trivial problem. In this paper, we propose to use replays to predict the strategy of players and make decision on the change of build orders. Experimental results on the public replay files show that the proposed method predicts opponent's strategy accurately and increases the chance of winning in the game.","2325-4270;23254270","Electronic:978-1-4673-5311-3; POD:978-1-4673-5310-6","10.1109/CIG.2013.6633666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6633666","Adaptation;Build Order;Decision Tree;Feature Expansion;Prediction;StarCraft;Strategy","Accuracy;Artificial intelligence;Buildings;Data mining;Decision trees;Games;Machine learning algorithms","artificial intelligence;computer games;real-time systems","AI competitions;RTS game;StarCraft AI bots;build order adaptation;computer players;fog-of-war;human leagues;opponent strategy;public replay files;real-time strategy game;replay-based strategy prediction;scouting behavior;scouting unit","","6","","18","","","11-13 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that makes use of all the colors (instead of only the colors of the selected seeds) available during the encoding stage.

Selecting the best feature subset causes better accuracy and efficiency in machine learning algorithms. In this paper, in order to obtain higher classification accuracy, effective features are selected using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In this evolutionary algorithm, some objectives such as minimizing feature number, maximizing classification accuracy, maximizing true positive rate (maximizing TPR), and minimizing false positive rate (minimizing FPR) are satisfied simultaneously and with no conflicts with each other. In the proposed method, selected features subset is given to a new ensemble algorithm with online refinement during training and testing phases. Final result of each new ensemble algorithm is obtained by the vote of the majority with respect to the accuracy of any voter. Results show the high efficiency and performance of proposed method in comparison with other methods. So that the WWW traffic classification accuracy ascend to 99.93%.

A learning algorithm for the T-DSN's weight matrices and tensors is developed and described in which the main parameter estimation burden is shifted to a convex subproblem with a closed-form solution. Using an efficient and scalable parallel implementation for CPU clusters, we train sets of T-DSNs in three popular tasks in increasing order of the data size: handwritten digit recognition using MNIST (60k), isolated state/phone classification and continuous phone recognition using TIMIT (1.1 m), and isolated phone classification using WSJ0 (5.2 m). Experimental results in all three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the T-DSN and the associated learning methods in a consistent manner. In particular, a sufficient depth of the T-DSN, a symmetry in the two hidden layers structure in each T-DSN block, our model parameter learning algorithm, and a softmax layer on top of T-DSN are shown to have all contributed to the low error rates observed in the experiments for all three tasks.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6389679","Deep learning;MNIST;TIMIT;WSJ;bilinear models;handwriting image classification;phone classification and recognition;stacking networks;tensor","Closed-form solutions;Computer architecture;Machine learning;Stacking;Tensile stress;Training;Vectors","convex programming;handwritten character recognition;higher order statistics;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;parameter estimation;pattern classification;tensors","CPU clusters;T-DSN weight matrices;bilinear mapping;closed-form solution;convex subproblem;hidden binary features;higher-order statistics;parallel implementation;parameter estimation;tensor deep stacking networks;weight tensor","","30","1","29","","20121220","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Current research in fuzzy systems shows that nonsingleton fuzzy sets can be used to model imprecise data. In this work, we study the relationship between positive definite kernels and TSK fuzzy systems with nonsingleton inputs. As a result, we define an extension of TSK fuzzy systems to deal with nonsingleton fuzzy input and we show that the interaction between fuzzy rules and nonsingleton fuzzy inputs induces a new class of PDK, the nonsingleton TSK kernel class, which are close related, but not equal, to Vapnik's vicinal kernels. Finally, based on nonsingleton TSK kernels and distance substitution kernels we give a general procedure to formulate PDKs for interval data. Experiments conducted with interval datasets show better performance than the state of the art approaches.","1098-7584;10987584","Electronic:978-1-4799-0022-0; POD:978-1-4799-0021-3","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2013.6622409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6622409","Positive definite kernel;imprecise data;kernel on fuzzy sets;nonsingleton TSK fuzzy system","Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Inference algorithms;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Pragmatics;Takagi-Sugeno model","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","PDK;Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system;Vapnik vicinal kernels;fuzzy rules;fuzzy set theory;learning machines;nonsingleton fuzzy input;positive definite kernels;supervised classification problems","","1","","38","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we show how we can learn a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) prior over the activities of the top-level features in a deep Boltzmann machine (DBM). This compound HDP-DBM model learns to learn novel concepts from very few training example by learning low-level generic features, high-level features that capture correlations among low-level features, and a category hierarchy for sharing priors over the high-level features that are typical of different kinds of concepts. We present efficient learning and inference algorithms for the HDP-DBM model and show that it is able to learn new concepts from very few examples on CIFAR-100 object recognition, handwritten character recognition, and human motion capture datasets.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6389680","Deep networks;deep Boltzmann machines;hierarchical Bayesian models;one-shot learning","Approximation methods;Bayesian methods;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Stochastic processes;Training;Vectors","Bayes methods;Boltzmann machines;handwritten character recognition;image motion analysis;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition","CIFAR-100 object recognition;HD model;compositional learning architecture;compound HDP-DBM model;deep Boltzmann machine;handwritten character recognition;hierarchical Dirichlet process;hierarchical-deep model;high-level features;human motion capture datasets;low-level generic features;structured hierarchical Bayesian model","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Humans;Motion;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Visual Perception","35","","47","","20121220","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
