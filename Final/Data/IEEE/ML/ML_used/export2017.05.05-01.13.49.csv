The consequence of fuzzy rules is refined through Q (λ)-learning. Then, the fuzzy reinforcement learning is employed to design controller of the robot system. The scheme of switching behavior-based FLC was presented, which includes avoidance obstacles behavior and wall-following behavior. This scheme can effectively solve the problem of navigation under complicated environment, which contains the concave obstacles.

Subspace methods utilize different algorithms to extract and analyze the underlying manifold for face recognition. Isomap is a recently proposed algorithm for manifold learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. However, since the Isomap is developed based on minimizing the reconstruction error with multi-dimensional scaling, it may not be optimal from classification viewpoint. In this paper, an improved version of Isomap, namely KFD-Isomap, is proposed using kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD) method for face recognition task. In KFD-Isomap, the matrix of geodesic distances between all pairs of points as feature vectors is applied to the kernel Fisher discriminant for finding an optimal projection direction. In face recognition experiments, KFD-Isomap is used as a feature extraction process compared with Isomap, Ext-Isomap, and two other baseline subspace algorithms, eigenfaces and Fisherfaces, combined with a nearest neighbor classifier. Experimental results show that KFD-Isomap excels the other methods.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527739","Face recognition;kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD);manifold, Isomap","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Geometry;Image reconstruction;Kernel;Manifolds;Nearest neighbor searches;Principal component analysis","face recognition;feature extraction;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra","KFD-Isomap;face recognition;facial images;feature extraction;feature vectors;geodesic distance matrix;image reconstruction;kernel Fisher discriminant;manifold learning;multidimensional scaling;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;optimal projection direction","","0","","14","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a given stable system, our purpose is to construct reduced-order systems, such that the error system between the two models is asymptotically stable and has a guaranteed L<sub> 1</sub> performance constraint. The L<sub> 1</sub> performance criterion is first established for time-delay systems, furthermore, the sufficient conditions for the existence of admissible reduced-order models are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) plus matrix inverse constraints.

The EA based multiuser detector takes the output of parallel interference cancellation (PIC) detector as the initial population and adopts maximum likelihood decision rule to detect the user bit sequences. During an EA running, the offspring population size is adaptively adjusted according to the current success probability. The major advantage of the adaptive EA based multiuser detection scheme is that it obtains rather good bit error rate (BER) performance with lower computational complexity.

So the application of traditional PCA-based fault detection method can bring many misdiagnoses. A reformative PCA-based fault detection method suitable for power plant process is proposed. First K-mean cluster analysis is used to classify the process data and obtain the data sets under the various stable operating condition. Then the PCM group is established using the classified data sets to describe the entire process. Finally the detecting sample is carried on fuzzy partition during fault detecting and the PCM suitable for current operating condition is dynamically calculated and used for fault detection. The field data is used to contrast the application of traditional method with reformative method in the fault detection of boiler process. The results indicate that the reformative method can adapt the operating condition change, reduce the misdiagnosis and enhance the detection sensitivity.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527298","K-means cluster analysis;Principal component analysis (PCA);fault detection;fuzzy partition;power plant process","Chemical processes;Covariance matrix;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Mathematical model;Phase change materials;Power generation;Principal component analysis;Production;Statistics","fuzzy set theory;power engineering computing;power plants;power system faults;principal component analysis","K-mean cluster analysis;boilers;data set classification;fault detection method;fuzzy partition;power plant process;principal component analysis;principal component model;statistical property","","0","","10","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there exist checkerboard patterns in most topology results, which makes topology extraction very difficult. In this investigation, a wavelet-based interpolation algorithm, which directly works with the optimization result to extract a checkerboard-free topology, is proposed. Firstly, auxiliary variables, which are mapped from topology variables, are decomposed by an orthogonal wavelet into approximation and detail coefficients. Secondly, the approximation coefficients are served as reference data for a cubic spline interpolation. The approximation coefficients are reconstructed after the interpolation. In order to evaluate the goodness of the algorithm proposed and determine an optimal resolution level selected in the wavelet decomposition, a method based on a volume constraint of the topology optimization is considered. Numerical simulation is carried out on a compliant force inverting mechanism. Simulation results show that the algorithm proposed is an effective remedy for checkerboard patterns in topology solutions and as a result a desired topology is extracted.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527419","Compliant mechanisms;cubic spline interpolation;topology extraction;wavelet","Constraint optimization;Data mining;Design optimization;Educational institutions;Filters;Interpolation;Machine learning algorithms;Numerical simulation;Spline;Topology","interpolation;mechanical engineering computing;optimisation;splines (mathematics);topology;wavelet transforms","checkerboard pattern;compliant force inverting mechanism;compliant mechanism;cubic spline interpolation;numerical simulation;orthogonal wavelet;topology extraction;topology optimization design;volume constraint;wavelet decomposition;wavelet-based interpolation","","0","","12","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since most of the kernel approaches reported have been treating the input as a long flat vector, such arrangement may increase the chances of “polluting” the feature element that uniquely identifies the selected image group. This paper proposes a two layer kernel configuration with an objective to improve the retrieval accuracy.

Combining the traditional color-histogram with some spatial information will greatly increase the accuracy of matching two color images. One advantage of color feature is that it is independent to the distortion of an image. However, with the introducing of spatial information, this advantage will disappear. In this paper, we propose a new method to compare two images, which based on symmetrical color-spatial feature (SCSF).

Debugging tries to locate the reason for incorrect program behavior by analyzing the states, which happen during a program's execution. In order to allow cyclic debugging, re-execution mechanisms are used most frequently. The dynamic characteristics of grid will hinder re-execution to work, because the behavior of a program will be various according to the current configuration of execution environment. By modeling grid environments with graphics, this paper proposes the metric to evaluate the similarity between grid applications execution environments.

Second, learners will begin to construct their concept map within one minute after reading the article. Third, learners will arrange their concept maps around twentieth minute; meanwhile, the frequency of constructing their concept maps will become low tide.

To measure the closeness between feature vectors, similarity metrics play a key role and they directly impact the clustering performance. This paper develops a framework of learning pseudo metrics (LPM) for semantic image clustering practice. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is employed to model the LPM with a set of criteria on evaluating the LPM quality and availability. Using a standard k-mean clustering technique, a comparative study is carried out to demonstrate the significance of our proposed LPM in semantic image clustering. Experiments show that the LPM-based similarity metric can produce better clustering results in terms of both impurity and robustness.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527819","Semantic images;clustering;learning pseudo metrics;neural networks","Availability;Computer science;Educational institutions;Image databases;Image recognition;Machine learning;Multilayer perceptrons;Prototypes;Silicon carbide;Spatial databases","feature extraction;image recognition;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pattern clustering","feature vector;image recognition;k-mean clustering technique;learning pseudo metrics;multilayer perceptron;semantic image clustering","","0","","11","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Fusion approach of formal semantics for the parsing of UDC sentences","Er-Qing Xu","Dept. of Linguistics, Zhejiang Univ., Hangzhou, China","2005 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20051107","2005","6","","3734","3743 Vol. 6","Aiming at the problem that the currently available parsing methods have difficulty in obtaining the D-structure/meaning of UDC sentences, this paper puts forward the fusion approach of formal semantics (FAFS), which combines λ-abstraction, λ-calculus, HPSG (head-driven phrase structure grammar), and knowledge in the realm of functional grammar. Firstly, employing the context-sensitive attribute grammar of HPSG, FAFS establishes the S-structure of UDCs, distinguishes between strong and weak UDCs, and extracts the fillers for the traces. Then FAFS obtains the WFF of UDCs according to the HPSG parse tree. In view of functional grammar, strong and weak UDCs are in fact ellipsis and substitution. With the result of HPSG parsing and filler extraction, as well as the WFF of UDCs, FAFS employs λ-abstraction and λ-calculus to derive the D-structure/meaning of a UDC and complete the parsing task. The overall computational efficiency of FAFS is in the cubic time, and thus FAFS is efficient. Finally, application examples were examined.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527590","FAFS;HPSG;Natural language understanding;lambda&#8212;abstraction;lambda&#8212;calculus","Calculus;Computational efficiency;Computer science;Cybernetics;Fuses;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Turing machines","grammars;lambda calculus;natural languages;programming language semantics","context-sensitive attribute grammar;filler extraction;formal semantics;functional grammar;fusion approach;head-driven phrase structure grammar;lambda-abstraction;lambda-calculus;natural language understanding;parsing method;unbounded dependency construction sentence","","0","","19","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As for multi-classifications, they are usually converted into binary ones, where unclassifiable regions usually exist. To overcome this drawback, a novel method called nesting support vector machine (NSVMS) for multi-classification is presented in this paper. Our ideas are as follows: firstly, construct the optimal hyperplanes based on one-against-one algorithm. Secondly, if there exist data points in the middle unclassifiable region, select them to construct optimal hyperplanes with the same hyperparameters. Thirdly, repeat the second step until there are no data points in the unclassifiable regions or the regions disappear. In order to examine the training accuracy and the generalization performance of the proposed algorithm, one-against-one algorithm, fuzzy least square support vector machine (FLS-SVM) and the proposed algorithm are applied to two UCI datasets.

To overcome this defect, RSO, a new adaptive crossover operator based on the rough set theory, is proposed. By using RSO, useful schemata can be found and have a higher probability of surviving recombination regardless of their defining length.

In the paper we present a distributed Q-learning algorithm to solving this problem. In our algorithm, the tasks of learning optimal action policy are distributed to each agent in team but not a central agent. In order to reduce the size of action-state space of multi-agent team we introduce a state-action space sharing strategy of agent team, through which one agent in team can use the states already explored by other agents before and need not take time to explore these states again. Additionally, our algorithm has the ability to allocate sub-goals dynamically among agents according to environment changing, which can make agent team coordinate more efficiently.

In contrast to the existing methods, the algorithm proposes a new approach of backward flexible mutex inference, avoids a complicated process of satisfaction degree propagation, and grantees to acquire the optimal plan.

It is a method for parameter estimation in various problems involving missing data. However, it is a batch learning method and often requires significant computational resources. So we need to develop more elaborate methods to adapt the databases with a large number of records or large dimensionality. In this paper, we present an algorithm which significantly reduces the intensity of computation. The algorithm is based on partial E-steps which has the standard convergence guarantee of EM. It is a version of the incremental EM algorithm which cycles through data cases in blocks. We confirm that the algorithm can reduce computational costs evidently through its application to large databases.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527465","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527465","EM algorithm;ILEM;incremental EM;lazy EM","Acceleration;Computational efficiency;Computer science;Convergence;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Iterative algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Maximum likelihood estimation;Parameter estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis;variational techniques;very large databases","EM algorithm;batch learning method;expectation maximization;incremental EM;large databases;parameter estimation;partial E-steps;statistical learning","","0","","8","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method simulates evaluation mode of instructor to some extent. The process of drum level variation is divided into three phases. There are different fuzzy demands for level control in each phase. Fuzzy evaluation method is used for evaluation factors in single phase. Then the comprehensive evaluation result is computed with the weighted average method of each factor in each phase. Simulation results show that the grade calculated by fuzzy evaluation method is closed to that by instructor. The grade for operator's operation is usually given by instructor subjectively.

In rough sets theory and other induction learning systems, discretization is an important algorithm and can be viewed as a process of information generalization (or abstraction) and data reduction. In this paper, a global discretization algorithm is proposed based on rough sets. It modifies the criterion of selecting the best cut points, and introduces inconsistency checking to preserve the fidelity of the original data, which change the MDLP method into a global one. Thus the reduction of cut points can be performed while keeping the consistency level. The proposed algorithm is tested by using several data sets with ID3 and ROSETTA. Experiments results show that this method performs better than MDLP, and is also superior to those which process continuous data directly without discretization.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527466","Consistency;Discretization;Reduction;Rough sets","Acceleration;Accuracy;Computer science;Cybernetics;Learning systems;Machine learning;Rough sets;Testing","data reduction;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory","cut point;data dependency;data reduction;global discretization;inconsistency checking;induction learning;information generalization;rough sets","","1","","11","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It composes of correlation matching algorithm, TD filter and ESO filter. This algorithm is used to predict the movement and to track the target. The position of target in the first image is supposed to be known. The problem is then to estimate the position of this template in subsequent images. By TD filter and ESO filter, it is possible to obtain the estimate position of the target in the current image. Then the correlation template matching algorithm is used to search target in the estimation position's neighbor in order to get target's accurate position. The simulation results of the algorithm are presented.

But it is seriously affected by the samples with gross error. Although M-estimation as object function can be used to solve the problem, its corresponding influence function is determined by the absolute value of error, thus a key problem is to choose initial parameters. In this paper, we propose an estimation method for regression function based on multiwavelet support vector machine (SVM). This method firstly puts forward and proves a new wavelet SVM used to determine initial parameters. It can determine reasonable network structure and appropriate initial parameters, which makes sure that there is bigger absolute value of residual error of samples with gross error. Then M-estimation is used as object function and the method used to determine the threshold is put forward. Simulation results show that regression model obtained with this proposed method not only has better approximation precision, but also improves robustness and generalization. It is conduced to widening the application for wavelet network.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527089","M-estimation;SVM;admissible support vector kernel;outlier case;regression","Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Industrial control;Kernel;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Physics;Regression analysis;Robustness;Support vector machines","estimation theory;regression analysis;sampling methods;support vector machines;unsupervised learning;wavelet transforms","M-estimation;SVM;admissible support vector kernel;neural network self-learning;regression estimation;robust multiwavelet support vector machine estimation method","","1","","6","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
