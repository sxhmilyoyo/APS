In the growth stage of a new product, the fraction of nonconforming (P) is often reduced rapidly due to the repetitive production and accumulation of experience. This phenomenon of diminishing the fraction of nonconforming has significant learning effect. In addition, along with some quality improvement projects which focus on reducing the fraction of nonconforming within a specific period, the learning effect of the fraction of nonconforming is more pronounced. In order to keep the monitoring effect of the control chart, the learning effect of the fraction of nonconforming should be considered in the p quality control chart. Meanwhile, there are possible interruptions between batches in the production system which generate forgetting. In this work, the proposed p quality control chart with the learning-forgetting effect of the fraction of nonconforming in the process has practical application value. Some p control charts can be used for comparison with and without consideration of the learning-forgetting effects.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890768","Control chart;Forgetting curve;Fraction of nonconforming;Learning curve","Abstracts;Control charts;Standards","control charts;learning systems;quality control","learning effects;learning-forgetting curve;learning-forgetting effects;monitoring effect;nonconforming;production system;quality control chart;quality control scheme;quality improvement project;repetitive production","","0","","16","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For NWKRE, the selection of bandwidth, i.e., smoothing parameter h, plays a very important role in the fitting performance. In order to enhance the performance of NWKRE, an adaptive Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression estimator is proposed, ANWKRE for short. There are two main strategies to determine the adaptive or local bandwidth factor λ: geometric mean and arithmetic mean based determination methods, respectively. In this paper, we firstly investigate the mathematical properties of geometric mean and arithmetic mean in the framework of regression analysis. Then, some experimental comparisons are conducted to demonstrate our theoretical results.

The proposed algorithm is based on the MAX-MIN Ant System and introduces a new adaptive discriminative premium penalty pheromone renewal strategy. The proposed strategy is based on the fact that a better path has much better sections and a worse path has much worse sections. By comparing the sections of the best and worst ant's paths, the algorithm carries out discriminative premium penalty pheromone renewal strategy to enhance the pertinence of pheromone release. The better sections will have more pheromone and the worse sections will have less pheromone. The discriminative pheromone release will strengthen the search guide of the region near the optimal solution. It can reduce the search of useless areas, and accelerate the convergence of solutions and their stabilities, so that the solution search efficiency will be enhanced. In order to avoid the defect that the higher penalty error rate and lower reward effectiveness rate at the primary stage may decrease algorithm performance, we take the strategy to update the incentive coefficient adaptively with the evolution process. The traveling salesman problem dataset has been selected to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The results show that both solution quality and convergence rate obtained by the proposed algorithm are better than that of the MAX-MIN Ant System.

The filter, being easy to implement, is based on the concept of augmenting a scaled and high-passed version of the image to itself. The UMF performance is critically dependent on the generation of the high-passed signal to be added as well as its associated scale factor. However, the optimal choice of filter parameters still remains a challenging task due to possible intensity clipping problems where the filtered pixel magnitude is vulnerable to be out of the permitted display ranges. In this research, an adaptive scheme is formulated such that the scale is derived from the pixel intensity of the input image. Specifically, pixels in the mid-range intensity will be assigned a larger scaling factor according to a Gaussian-like profile. In addition, the optimal profile coefficients and the width of the high-pass generator window are determined by adopting the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Satisfactory simulation results obtained from a collection of a large set of images have shown the effectiveness of the proposed image contrast enhancement approach.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890408","Adaptive scale adjustment;Kernel design;Particle swarm optimization;Unsharp masking","Abstracts;Educational institutions;Image color analysis","adaptive filters;image enhancement;particle swarm optimisation","Gaussian-like profile;UMF;adaptive scale adjustment design;filtered pixel magnitude;high-pass generator window;image contrast enhancement;image pixel intensity;image processing front ends;optimal profile coefficients;particle swarm optimization algorithm;unsharp masking filters","","1","","11","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Locality preserving projection (LPP) addresses this problem approvingly, where the neighborhood information can be preserved in the reduced space. Based on typical behaviors of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a novel discriminant analysis framework under penalty constraint(PFDA), which extends the ideas of LDA and LPP, is developed in this paper. Benefiting from different construction of affinity matrix, our method can also preserve the locality embedding information effectively in the reduced space.

In this paper, a multi-view-based manifold learning algorithm is proposed for detecting the falling events. This algorithm should be able to detect people falling down in any direction. First, the walking patterns in a normal speed are modeled by the locality preserving projection (LPP).

However, by using intelligent fuzzy Ziegler-Nichols-based PID controller design, the overshoot of the temperature was 12%, the temperature rise and the settling times were 0.7 sec and 1 sec, respectively.

Moreover, this paper also took the system disturbance variation effect into consideration, e.g. the current requirement was increased by 100% for climbing a slope or speed-up conditions; note a large 60% temperature overshoot was produced by using Ziegler-Nichols based PID controller.

The statistic-based method analyzes standard deviation of spatial data to determine the number of cluster, whereas the simulation-based method analyzes the training performance of artificial neural network. The proposed methods were applied to the spatial rainfall data in the northeast region of Thailand. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods could provide reasonable results. The statistic-based method is statistically explainable for human analysts, whereas the simulation-based is an easy-to-use technique for cluster validation.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890861","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890861","Artificial neural network;Cluster validation method;Fuzzy c-means;Northeast region of Thailand;Spatial rainfall data;Standard deviation","Abstracts;Educational institutions","geophysics computing;interpolation;neural nets;pattern clustering;rain;statistical analysis;visual databases","Thailand northeast region;artificial neural network;cluster validation methods;easy-to-use technique;global spatial data partition;simulation-based method;spatial interpolation models;spatial rainfall data localization;standard deviation;statistic-based method;training performance","","2","","12","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is not an easy task to translate declarative sentences into logical formulas. On the other hand, in some intelligent system applications, it is necessary to translate logical formulas into declarative sentences for usual. To do the translation, the correspondence between the vocabulary of the logical formulas and that of declarative sentences is demanded. Thus, a supporting tool for translation from logical formulas to declarative sentences must cooperate with a supporting tool for translation from declarative sentences to logical formulas. However, there are no reports about such supporting tools. This paper presents a supporting tool for translation between declarative sentences and logical formulas. The tool works with its users in an interactive mode. The tool makes users revise a target declarative sentence in order to translate declarative sentences into logical formulas. It also translates revised declarative sentences into logical formulas according to its user's instructions, and records correspondence between the vocabulary of declarative sentences and that of logical formulas. Moreover, it translates logical formulas into declarative sentences according to the correspondence.

Much important information is stored and processed in the Smartphones. It attracts the attention of hackers. Malware is one of the most common security issues in Smartphone, especially for the Android system due to its compatibility. In this paper, we focus on the Android malicious application problem. As malwares with different purposes have different properties, only using a single classifier to discriminate the benign and malicious application may not be good enough. A detection method using Multiple Classifier System is proposed. Each base classifier is responsible for one type of malware. Android applications are classified as malwares when any one of base classifier decides they are malwares. The feature selection has been applied for each base classifier separately to increase the performance.

Firstly, we apply a manifold-preserving graph reduction algorithm to construct the single-task sparse Gaussian processes from a sparse graph perspective. Then, we propose a multitask sparsity regularizer to simultaneously sparsify multiple Gaussian processes from related tasks. The regularizer can encourage the global structures of retained points from closely related tasks to be more similar, while disencourage those from loosely related tasks. Experimental results show that our single-task sparse Gaussian processes are comparable to one state-of-the-art method, and our multitask sparsity regularizer can generate multitask sparse Gaussian processes which are more effective than those obtained from other methods.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890748","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890748","Manifold-preserving graph reduction;Multitask sparsity regularizer;Sparse Gaussian processes","Abstracts;Sun","Bayes methods;Gaussian processes;graph theory;regression analysis","Bayesian inference;classification problem;cubic scaling problem;manifold-preserving graph reduction algorithm;multitask sparse Gaussian process;multitask sparsity regularizer;regression problem;single-task sparse Gaussian process;sparse graph","","0","","16","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many parallel clustering algorithms have been proposed, however, few are proposed for networks with the clustering criteria that uses the structure of networks and connectivity of vertices. In this paper, we present a parallel network clustering algorithm based on a structural similarity measure which can identify not only clusters in networks but also hubs and outliers. Our Parallel Structural Clustering Algorithm adapts the Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks (SCAN) to a parallel environment.

The analysis in continuous space function is rare nowadays in comparison to that in discrete space. In this paper, we extend the general drift theory to analyze the complexity of optimization problem in continuous space, by proposing a new version of Variable Drift-Johannsen theorem. Comparing with general drift analysis, we establish a tighter upper bound for continuous optimization by integration for every problem that is monotonic in drift. Finally, we apply the proposed theory to a continuous (1+1)EA algorithm which is the basic framework of evolutionary algorithm(EA) in continuous space. The continuous (1+1)EA is similar with (1+1)EA except for its elitism strategy. In addition, its solutions are transferred to continuous space and mutations are implemented randomly by obeying one single probability distribution. It means that the continuous (1+1)EA requires exponential time complexity. Both the upper and lower bounds of the (1+1)EA with the mutation of (0,1)-normal distribution are bounding above that of the (1+1)EA with the mutation of (¿1,1)-uniform distribution.

But the existing algorithms can not fully utilize the information in dimensionality reduction as the side information is treated equally. A new semi-supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called Geodesic distance based semi-supervised locality dimensionality reduction (GSLDR) is proposed for the handwriting data to overcome the shortcomings. Since Euclidean distance cannot really reflect the structure of data, we adopt geodesic distance as the measurement. Then the algorithm expands the pairwise constraints to strengthen the guiding role of the constraints in dimensionality reduction, and add the constraints to the nearest neighbor graph to make the graph reflect realistic manifold structure of the data. At last, the proposed method is applied to the writer identification.

This model aims to assist lecturers to supervise students, and to pay extra attention for students who are likely to get marginal results that could lead to withdrawal prior to completion of that subject. The e-Grade model comprises two sub-models that are Likelihood of Grade Before midterm examination, and Likelihood of Grade After midterm examination. In the experiment, two datasets are used. The results will provide supports to counsel the students on their possible performance and classroom achievement. The usefulness of the proposed e-Grade model for the monitoring of students' progress is verified against benchmark data.

We use linear kernel regression to learn a map between the space of high-resolution images and the space of blurred high-resolution images that are the interpolation results obtained from the corresponding low-resolution images, because linear kernel regression is simple and has low computational complexity compared with nonlinear kernel regression. In a computational viewpoint, the super-resolution image reconstruction can be transformed to solve linear equations whose size depends on the number of the training data. When the amount of the training data is large, it is time-consuming to solve the regression problem. In order to solve this problem quickly, we select part of the pairwise patches from the training dataset by K-means method instead of all the training data and use these patches to construct a moderate scale regression problem. Furthermore, we implement orthogonal matching pursuit to improve the speed of solving linear equations obtaining from the moderate linear regression problem.

First, by measuring the similarity between items, we select the items that form the pairs of mutually k-nearest neighbor and reversed k-nearest neighbor. These items are used to construct k-nearest neighbor cliques. Since the relationship between items in the same clique is a total order, they have a high similarity to each other.

Their effectiveness often play crucial roles in the success of subsequent image operations such as feature segmentation or object recognition. In order to obtain high quality images, the bilateral filer (BF) and the unsharp masking filter (UMF) have often been used as attractive candidates for their proven performances in noise removal and contrast enhancement. The BF is able to remove noises while preserving edge sharpness. On the other hand, the UMF is capable of increasing image contrast. Since the BF is not designed for contrast enhancement and the UMF is not developed for noise reduction, their strengths may not be fully utilized for image quality improvement. In this work, the two filters are integrated in a pipelined process such that the resultant image noise is reduced while the contrast is increased.

It is an application in various fields, including astronomy, medicine, food safety, forensics, and target detection.

Generalized discriminant analysis (GDA), a kernel-based (nonlinear) linear discriminant analysis (LDA), has been applied to hyperspectral image classification for avoiding the Hughes phenomenon. Nevertheless, the performances of GDA are based on choosing the proper kernel function or proper parameters of a kernel function. In our previous work, an automatic method for selecting the radial basis function (RBF) parameter, APR, for a support vector machine (SVM) was proposed. This study applies APR to determine the parameter of GDA with RBF kernel and proposes a kernel-based classification scheme for hyperspectral image classification.
