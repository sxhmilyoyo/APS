We assume that all the schemas are represented by ontologies and we propose a summarization algorithm which produces a summary containing the maximum number of relevant concepts and the minimum number of non-relevant concepts of the initial ontology.

This research has found that the ill coefficient matrix of the linear equations is the key obstacle in retrieving the vertical speed field and other parameters. Based on the numerical analysis theory, the feasible algorithm has also been studied as an attempt to solve the ill matrix problem in linear equations. Numerical experiments have also been conducted with single-Doppler radar data, and the retrieval results are verified with dual-Doppler radar data observed in HUBEX_IOP. The research results show that the better retrieval of three dimension wind field can be obtained with the improved VVP method.

To resolve the semantic problems related to TF approaches, the proposed technique disambiguates the words contained in a document and creates a list of super ordinates based on an external knowledge source. In order to reduce the dimension of the document vector, the final set of index values is created by extracting a set of common concepts, shared by multiple related words, from the list of hypernyms. Subsequently, a weight is assigned to each concept index by considering its position in the knowledge source's hierarchical tree (i.e. distance from the substituted words) and its number of occurrences. By applying the proposed technique, we were able to disambiguate words within different contexts, extrapolate concepts from documents, assigning appropriate normalised weights, and significantly reduce the vector dimension.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3882-2; POD:978-1-4244-5258-3","10.1109/ENC.2009.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452538","","Computational efficiency;Computer science;Data analysis;Extrapolation;Frequency;Indexing;Informatics;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Ontologies","indexing;knowledge acquisition;natural language processing;query processing;semantic Web;text analysis;vocabulary;word processing","TF;Term Frequency;common concepts extraction;conceptual indexing technique;document indexing;document vector dimension;external knowledge source;hierarchical tree;hypernyms;multiple related words;semantic problems;super ordinates list","","1","","16","","","21-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We refer this problem as ""attributes selection"" problem. Package design based on user input is a problem that has also attracted recent interest. Given a set of elements, and a set of user preferences (where each preference is a conjunction of positive or negative preferences for individual elements), we investigate the problem of designing the most ""popular package"", i.e., a subset of the elements that maximizes the number of satisfied users. Numerous instances of this problem occur in practice. We refer this later problem as ""package design"" problem. We develop several formulations of both the problems. Even for the NP-complete problems, we give several exact (optimal) and approximation algorithms that work well in practice.

Typically pose recognition is carried out using images from a single camera, however this approach is sensitive to occlusions and restricted fields of view, both of which are common in the outdoor sports environment. This paper presents a novel technique for the automatic matching of human activities which operates on the 3D data available in a multi-camera broadcast environment. Shape is retrieved using multi-camera techniques to generate a 3D representation of the scene. Use of 3D data renders the system camera-pose-invariant and allows it to work while cameras are moving and zooming. By comparing the reconstructions to an appropriate 3D library, action matching can be achieved in the presence of significant calibration and matting errors which cause traditional pose detection schemes to fail. An appropriate feature descriptor and distance metric are presented as well as a technique to use these features for key-pose detection and action matching. The technique is then applied to real footage captured at an outdoor sporting event.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4124-2; Electronic:978-1-4244-4441-0; POD:978-1-4244-4442-7","10.1109/ICCVW.2009.5457724","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457724","","Broadcasting;Cameras;Data analysis;Humans;Image motion analysis;Image recognition;Information retrieval;Libraries;Motion analysis;Shape","feature extraction;image matching;image motion analysis;image reconstruction;pose estimation;shape recognition","3D action matching;3D representation;feature descriptor;human action matching;key pose detection;motion capture library;multicamera broadcast environment;outdoor sports broadcast environments;shape retrieval","","12","2","25","","","Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Semantic gap, which is the disparity between user's request and query results, has been identified as a challenging issue. In this paper, we are interested in scientific document indexing for retrieval. Knowing the structure of such a document is helpful to the retrieval process, as the document is decomposed into different elements and specific indexing methods are applied to the different element types. Also, as the document is viewed as a composition of many elements, query responses may return some of the elements instead of the entire document.

Using a patch based motion descriptor and matching scheme, we can achieve promising results on three different action datasets with a single clip as the template. Our results are comparable to previously published results using much larger training sets. We also present a method for learning a transferable distance function for these patches. The transferable distance function learning extracts generic knowledge of patch weighting from previous training sets, and can be applied to videos of new actions without further learning. Our experimental results show that the transferable distance function learning not only improves the recognition accuracy of the single clip action recognition, but also significantly enhances the efficiency of the matching scheme.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4124-2; Electronic:978-1-4244-4441-0; POD:978-1-4244-4442-7","10.1109/ICCVW.2009.5457663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457663","","Biological system modeling;Biomedical optical imaging;Computer vision;Humans;Image motion analysis;Information retrieval;Optical filters;Surveillance;Training data;Videos","feature extraction;image matching;image motion analysis;image recognition;video signal processing","human action recognition;learning based approaches;matching scheme;motion descriptor;single clip per action;transferable distance function learning","","7","","26","","","Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The comparison oracle, given two reference objects and a query object, returns the reference object closest to the query object. The oracle attempts to model the behavior of human users, capable of making statements about similarity, but not of assigning meaningful numerical values to distances between objects. We develop nearest-neighbor search algorithms and analyze its performance for such an oracles. Using such a comparison oracle, the best we can hope for is to obtain, for every object in the database, a ranking of the other objects according to their distance to it. The difficulty of searching using such an oracle depends on the non-homogeneities of the underlying space. We introduce the new idea of a rank-sensitive hash (RSH) function which gives same hash value for ¿¿similar¿¿ objects based on the rank-value of the objects obtained from the similarity oracle. As one application of RSH, we demonstrate that, we can retrieve one of the (1 + ¿¿)r-nearest neighbor of a query point in time-complexity depending on an underlying property (termed rank-distortion) of the search space. We use this idea to implement a navigation system for an image database of human faces. In particular, we design a database for images that is organized adaptively based on both baseline comparisons using eigenfaces and refined using selected human input. We present a preliminary implementation of this system which seeks to minimize the number of questions asked to a (human) oracle.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7014-3; POD:978-1-4244-7012-9","10.1109/ITA.2010.5454139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5454139","","Algorithm design and analysis;Extraterrestrial measurements;Face;Feature extraction;Humans;Image databases;Information retrieval;Navigation;Nearest neighbor searches;Performance analysis","computational complexity;face recognition;query processing;search problems;visual databases","RSH function;comparison oracle;eigenface;facebrowsing;human face;human user behaviour;image database;navigation system;nearest-neighbor search algorithm;query object;rank value;rank-distortion;rank-sensitive hash;reference object;searching;time-complexity","","2","","20","","","Jan. 31 2010-Feb. 5 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the protection of data privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a very challenging task. Although traditional searchable encryption schemes allow a user to securely search over encrypted data through keywords and selectively retrieve files of interest, these techniques support only exact keyword search. That is, there is no tolerance of minor typos and format inconsistencies which, on the other hand, are typical user searching behavior and happen very frequently. This significant drawback makes existing techniques unsuitable in Cloud Computing as it greatly affects system usability, rendering user searching experiences very frustrating and system efficacy very low. In this paper, for the first time we formalize and solve the problem of effective fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data while maintaining keyword privacy. Fuzzy keyword search greatly enhances system usability by returning the matching files when users' searching inputs exactly match the predefined keywords or the closest possible matching files based on keyword similarity semantics, when exact match fails. In our solution, we exploit edit distance to quantify keywords similarity and develop an advanced technique on constructing fuzzy keyword sets, which greatly reduces the storage and representation overheads. Through rigorous security analysis, we show that our proposed solution is secure and privacy-preserving, while correctly realizing the goal of fuzzy keyword search.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4244-5838-7; POD:978-1-4244-5836-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462196","","Cloud computing;Cryptography;Data privacy;Fuzzy systems;Impedance matching;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Outsourcing;Protection;Usability","Internet;cryptography;data privacy;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval","cloud computing;data privacy;data protection;encrypted data;files matching;fuzzy keyword search;user searching behavior","","169","1","16","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, a multimedia indexing system must not only face the challenge of a providing scalability and performance, but should also allow for interoperability with legacy code and integration of new processes. With these goals in mind, this paper presents a loosely coupled, asynchronous, distributed event-based SOA media indexing system, making use of Web services and Enterprise Service Bus technologies and contrasts it with different application distribution approaches, with regards to the throughput, scalability, and response time when executing the tasks required for analyzing and indexing of large media document collections.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3882-2; POD:978-1-4244-5258-3","10.1109/ENC.2009.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452524","","Content based retrieval;Delay;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Scalability;Service oriented architecture;Throughput;Web services","Web services;document handling;indexing;information retrieval;multimedia computing","Web services;application distribution approach;asynchronous indexing;distributed event based SOA media indexing system;enterprise service bus technologies;media assets;multimedia documents;multimedia indexing system;multimedia information retrieval","","0","","13","","","21-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, recent ways to describe catalogue tree, such as xml or database tables, lead fixed structure which is difficult to change, reuse and extend when facing masses of real-time spatial data. The directory service (OpenGIS Catalogue Services) standard developed by OGC (OpenGIS Consortium) only defines the directory service interoperable interface specifications but lacks of organizations and technology to implement. Thus, it is indispensable to develop a new method to manage masses of spatial data in spatial data warehouse or spatial data center systems in a facile, flexible and real-time way. Through analyzing common methods of representing and building catalogue system, this paper presents the novel concept of dynamic spatial data catalogue (DSDC) based upon these traditional model. Firstly, DSDC builds up a highly abstracted catalogue model for general directory description. Then, combining with the requirements of GIS application system, it developed a dynamic spatial data catalogue technique and mechanism using rules and scripts to produce the dynamic effect of catalogue representation. It detailedly introduced the key approach of the implementation using XML as the define language of rule, and using python as the script language. In this way, the catalog system will meet the requirements of faster development, easier extension, heterogeneous spatial data resource integration and real time reaction in a flexible way. DSDC technology is also an approach to build or integrate with any GIS systems rapidly. This paper discusses some applications of DSDC in various appropriate occasions, illustrates the integration of DSDC with MapGIS data center platform, and gives the application of DSDC in specific GIS application development and building- - process. The DSDC technology has been implemented and used in managing national 1:50000 basic geographic database resource and weather spatial data of Wuhan dynamically.

"Multihypothesis Viterbi Data Association: Algorithm Development and Assessment","G. W. Pulford; B. F. La Scala","QinetiQ, UK","IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","20100506","2010","46","2","583","609","Two algorithms for tracking in clutter, based on the Viterbi algorithm are presented: single-target Viterbi data association (ST-VDA) and multihypothesis VDA (MH-VDA). MH-VDA is designed specifically for multiple-target tracking (MTT), although ST-VDA still achieves good performance on MTT problems. The basic philosophy of both methods is to set up an optimisation problem for the sequence of measurement-to-target associations rather than directly seeking the target state estimates. The joint optimisation problem for the data association sequence is decomposed into a sequence of scalar optimisation problems by means of an approximate forward dynamic programming recursion to which the Viterbi algorithm is applicable. Once the data association problem is solved, the target state estimates can be retrieved by backtracking. The operation of the algorithms is easily visualised as a search on a trellis for the optimal path. For ST-VDA, nodes in the trellis correspond to measurements. For MH-VDA, nodes correspond to multitarget data association hypotheses. Conventional measurement gating is extended to work within this context. Results from simulations that compare the performance of ST-VDA and MH-VDA with four, standard, zero-scan-back tracking approaches are given. The performance assessment includes metrics for track loss and track swaps in a multiple crossing target context. The Viterbi data association (VDA) algorithms are shown to outperform the alternative algorithms. In particular the ST-VDA is found to have the best track swap performance, while MH-VDA has the lowest track loss figure. Average state estimation errors for both VDA algorithms are only about 10% larger than a Kalman filter with known data associations. While both variants of VDA are essentially batch processing approaches, the simulation results indicate that the algorithms can be implemented with a fixed processing lag of only a few scans without significant loss in performance.","0018-9251;00189251","","10.1109/TAES.2010.5461643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5461643","","Australia;Dynamic programming;Information retrieval;Optimization methods;Particle filters;Performance loss;State estimation;Target tracking;Visualization;Viterbi algorithm","Viterbi detection;dynamic programming;radar detection;radar tracking;sensor fusion;target tracking","Kalman filter;approximate forward dynamic programming recursion;batch processing;measurement-to-target associations;multihypothesis VDA;multiple target tracking;optimisation problem;single-target Viterbi data association;target state estimates;track loss figure;track swaps;zero-scan-backtracking","","13","","70","","","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Treating data collections as metric objects brings a great advantage in generality, because a single metric technique can be applied to many specific search problems quite different in nature. In this paper, we concentrate our attention on a special form of join, the Self Similarity Join, which retrieves pairs from the same dataset. In particular, we consider the case in which the dataset is split into subsets that are searched for self similarity join independently (e. g, as in a distributed computing environment).

Several biword-based schemes have been proposed leading to good compression ratios. Bearing in mind Melamed's affirmation which states that ""the translation of a text into another language can be viewed as a detailed annotation of what that text means"", we propose a new model for bitexts in agreement with this affirmation, dubbed MAR.

However, past researches on conditioning probabilistic databases, unfortunately, only focus on functional dependency. In real world applications, most additional information on uncertain data sets can be acquired in the form of aggregate constraints (e.g., the aggregate results are published online for various statistical purposes). Therefore, if these aggregate constraints can be taken into account, uncertainty in data sets can be largely reduced. However, finding a practical method to exploit aggregate constraints to decrease uncertainty is a very challenging problem. In this paper, we present three approaches to cleanse (condition) uncertain databases by employing aggregate constraints. Because the problem is NP-hard, we focus on the two approximation strategies by modeling the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and then utilizing Simulated Annealing (SA) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to sample from the entire solution space of possible worlds. In order to favor those possible worlds holding higher probabilities and satisfying all the constraints at the same time, we define Satisfaction Degree Functions (SDF) and then construct the objective function accordingly. Subsequently, based on the sample result, we remove duplicates, re-normalize the probabilities of all the qualified possible worlds, and derive the posterior probabilistic database. Our experiments verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms and show that our approximate approaches scale well to large-sized databases.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6523-1; POD:978-1-4244-6522-4; USB:978-1-4244-6521-7","10.1109/ICDEW.2010.5452733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452733","","Aggregates;Application software;Asia;Computer science;Databases;Equations;Information retrieval;Remuneration;Software engineering;Uncertainty","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;simulated annealing;statistical databases;uncertainty handling","NP hard problem;aggregate constraints;evolutionary algorithm;nonlinear optimization problem;objective function;satisfaction degree functions;simulated annealing;uncertain databases cleansing","","0","","20","","","1-6 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show how to generalize locality-sensitive hashing to accommodate arbitrary kernel functions, making it possible to preserve the algorithm's sub-linear time similarity search guarantees for a wide class of useful similarity functions. Since a number of successful image-based kernels have unknown or incomputable embeddings, this is especially valuable for image retrieval tasks.

Although it has made significant progress over the last decade, the current CF method is stressed by the sparsity problem. In this paper we propose a novel approach to address this issue. Multiple Imputation (MI) is a useful statistic strategy for dealing with data sets with missing values and replace each missing value with a set of plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the right value. In our approach we apply MI technique in the data processing procedure to turn the original sparse data into dense data. And then we use the dense data and the original data in the following CF progress separately. We compare their performance both in cosine-based and correlation-based similarity measures. We conduct a 10-fold cross validation and take the MAE as the evaluation metrics.

In Naive Bayes model, the word probabilities for a class are estimated by calculating the likelihood in the entire training documents where the training and test data are split randomly into k-subsets like 2/3 for training and 1/3 for test data. In addition, it also utilizes two level hierarchy structures for training documents like features from title, keywords and content with the predefined knowledge available.

This method exploits the weight of term and document frequency to construct the correlation between a term and each class. It aims to maximize the differences of term over each class based on information theory. We design a better evaluation function to yield a kind of ranking of the features.

In this work, it is proposed a new method of image segmentation, indexation and retrieval by content. In this paper an image is not considered as a set of objects, is considered as a feature vector where its components represent a segment of color. Color is treated in another color space rather than to work on RGB space. For each image a fuzzy histogram is obtained in order to get for each image its own signature together whit its own feature vector. Fuzzy theory is applied to solve color uncertainty, which it comes from color quantification and human perception of colors.

These approaches are presented in the framework of classical query evaluation procedures that rely upon cost models heavily dependent on metadata (e.g. statistics and cardinality estimates) and that typically are restricted to execution time estimation. There are computational environments where metadata acquisition and support is very expensive. Additionally, execution time is not the only optimization objective of interest. A ubiquitous computing environment is an appropriate example where classical query optimization techniques are not useful any more. In order to solve this problem, this article presents a query optimization technique based on learning, particularly on case-based reasoning. Given a query, the knowledge acquired from previous experiences is exploited in order to propose reasonable solutions. It is possible to learn from each new experience in order to suggest better solutions to solve future queries.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3882-2; POD:978-1-4244-5258-3","10.1109/ENC.2009.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452548","case-based reasoning;classical query optimization techniques;learning;metadata;similarity function;ubiquitous computing environment","Automation;Costs;Energy consumption;Energy storage;Information retrieval;Personal digital assistants;Pervasive computing;Query processing;Statistics;Ubiquitous computing","case-based reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);meta data;query processing;ubiquitous computing","case-based reasoning;learning;metadata;query evaluation;query optimization;ubiquitous environment","","0","5","15","","","21-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the current algorithms for product search are based on adaptations of theoretical models devised for Â¿classicÂ¿ information retrieval. However, the decision mechanism that underlies the process of buying a product is different than the process of judging a document as relevant or not. So, applying theories of relevance for the task of product search may not be the best approach. We propose a theory model for product search based on expected utility theory from economics. Specifically, we propose a ranking technique in which we rank highest the products that generate the highest consumer surplus after the purchase. In a sense, we rank highest the products that are the Â¿best value for moneyÂ¿ for a specific user. Our approach naturally builds on decades of research in the field of economics and presents a solid theoretical foundation in which further research can build on. We instantiate our research by building a search engine for hotels, and show how we can build algorithms that naturally take into account consumer demographics, heterogeneity of consumer preferences, and also account for the varying price of the hotel rooms. Our extensive user studies demonstrate an overwhelming preference for the rankings generated by our techniques, compared to a large number of existing strong baselines.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6523-1; POD:978-1-4244-6522-4; USB:978-1-4244-6521-7","10.1109/ICDEW.2010.5452727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452727","","Adaptation model;Business;Demography;Information management;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Predictive models;Recommender systems;Search engines;Web and internet services","Internet;electronic commerce;information retrieval;purchasing","Internet;commercial goods;commercial services;economic theory;information retrieval;online search;product search improvement","","0","","11","","","1-6 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an approach for retrieving critical and non critical data with different security constraints by coordinating services. Thanks to contracts describing the logic of a services based application running in a dynamic environment, it is possible to associate a personalized secure behavior in an orthogonal way. Contracts ensure, for example, integrity and authentication of services at execution time in the presence of exceptions and make applications aware of their execution context.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3882-2; POD:978-1-4244-5258-3","10.1109/ENC.2009.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452519","Contract;Non-Functional Properties;Services Coordination","Authentication;Context-aware services;Contracts;Data security;Information resources;Information retrieval;Information security;Logic programming;Organizing;Robustness","Internet;information resources;information retrieval;message authentication","Web 2.0;contracts;coordinating services security;data retrieval;information resources;security constraints;service authentication","","0","","9","","","21-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The robot thus has to initiate communication by asking for the way, and retrieves information from passers-by showing the way by gestures (pointing) and marking goal positions on a still image on the touch screen of the robot. The aims of the field trial where threefold: (1) Investigating the aptitude of the navigation architecture, (2) Evaluating the intuitiveness of the interaction concept for the passers-by, (3) Assessing people's willingness to support the ACE robot in its task, i.e. assessing the social acceptability. The field trial demonstrates that the architecture enables successful autonomous path finding without any prior map knowledge just by route directions given by passers-by.

In order to use the self-similarity descriptor for efficient retrieval we make three contributions: (i) we sparsify the descriptor points by locating discriminative regions within each image, thus reducing the computational expense of shape matching; (ii) we extend to enable matching despite changes in scale; and (iii) we show that vector quantizing the descriptor does not inhibit performance, thus providing the basis of a large-scale shape-based retrieval system using a bag-of-visual-words approach.

The approximate nearest neighbor query is proposed and applied to get high performance to ease the curse of dimensionality to a certain extent. However, the heuristic pruning method may prune many local optimal solutions so that it is impossible to make sure to what extent the final results meet users' needs. With the nearest neighbor as input, this paper proposes a method to get extent how the input meets user's need based on fuzzy control, and then determines whether or not the input will be an approximate optimal solution with a comparison between the extent and threshold value. At the same time, the genetic algorithm is used to complete the adaptive study process of the threshold value to reflect users' approximate needs.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6389-3; POD:978-1-4244-6388-6","10.1109/ETCS.2010.383","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459132","Demand Degree;Fuzzy Control;Genetic Algorithm;Pruning;Rule Base","Application software;Computer science;Computer science education;Databases;Educational technology;Fuzzy control;Genetic algorithms;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Probability","fuzzy control;genetic algorithms;heuristic programming;indexing;query processing","fuzzy control;genetic algorithm;heuristic pruning method;high-dimensional approximate neighbor query;index-based nearest neighbor retrieval","","1","","5","","","6-7 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we target at solving the automatic image annotation problem in a novel semi-supervised learning framework. A novel multi-label correlated Green's function approach is proposed to annotate images over a graph. The correlations among labels are integrated into the objective function which improves the performance significantly. We also propose a new adaptive decision boundary method for multi-label assignment to deal with the difficulty of label assignment in most of the existing rank-based multi-label classification algorithms. Instead of setting the threshold heuristically or by experience, our method principally compute it upon the prior knowledge in the training data. We perform our methods on three commonly used image annotation testing data sets. Experimental results show significant improvements on classification performance over four other state-of-the-art methods. As a general semi-supervised learning framework, other local feature based image annotation methods could be easily incorporated into our framework to improve the performance.","1550-5499;15505499","Electronic:978-1-4244-4419-9; POD:978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459447","","Computer science;Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Data engineering;Green's function methods;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Pairwise error probability;Semisupervised learning;Training data","Green's function methods;graph theory;image classification;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);query formulation","Web/database image search;adaptive decision boundary method;graph;image annotation;image understanding;multi-label classification algorithms;multi-label correlated Green function;semi-supervised learning","","14","","24","","","Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
