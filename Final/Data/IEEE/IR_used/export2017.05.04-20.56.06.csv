The mqr-tree improves utilizes a different node organization, set of validity rules and insertion strategy. A comparison versus the R-tree shows significant improvements in overlap and overcoverage, with comparable height and space utilization.

These tags are added by users that interact with the items. In this paper, it is shown to what extent different ways of creating the tags result in similar or non-similar information about the item. Three types of affective tags are being considered here: explicit self-assessed tags, implicit multimedia-based tags, and implicit physiology-based tags. The novelty of this paper is to show that affect-based retrieval accuracy (as measured by precision and recall) benefits from having a database that contains both explicit and implicit tags. A database that contains a mixture of explicit and implicit tags has higher retrieval accuracy when compared to a database that contains uniquely either explicit or implicit tags. This shows that information in explicit and implicit tags is complementary rather than redundant. The improvement in retrieval accuracy is immediately evident when explicit tags are added. Results for low recall rates are of particular importance because these focus on the most relevant items in a database. When over 60% of the items in the database with implicit tags are also tagged by explicit tags, retrieval accuracy at a low recall rate (0.1) is higher than accuracy based uniquely on explicit tags.","2156-8103;21568103","POD:978-1-4244-4800-5","10.1109/ACII.2009.5349433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349433","","Biomedical monitoring;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Facial features;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Motion pictures;Multimedia databases;Spatial databases;Tagging","information retrieval;multimedia computing","affect-based multimedia retrieval;affect-based retrieval accuracy;explicit self-assessed tags;explicit tags;implicit multimedia-based tags;implicit physiology-based tags;implicit tags;simultaneous exploitation","","1","","19","","","10-12 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Shot changes may occur with either abrupt or gradual shot transition. In abrupt shot transition, the change of video content occurs over a single frame. In gradual shot transition, however, the content change takes place gradually through a short sequence of frames. The gradual transition is also divided into several subgroups such as dissolve, pan, zoom and wipe. In the literature, there exist numerous methods to detect shot changes. While these methods are able to detect abrupt changes properly, they usually fail to detect gradual changes. This paper proposes a new method for detecting gradual shot changes successfully. The proposed method employs fractal dimension information of gray scale video frames. In the experimental work, efficacy of fractal based gradual shot change detection method is tested on soccer videos including different types of gradual shot changes and compared with well known pixel and histogram based shot change detection methods. Results of the experimental study indicate that the proposed method yields higher accuracy with respect to other methods in most cases.","","POD:978-1-4244-5106-7","10.1109/ELECO.2009.5355249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355249","","Cameras;Databases;Fractals;Gunshot detection systems;Histograms;Image analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;Organizing;Video equipment","feature extraction;fractals;sport;video signal processing","abrupt shot transition;fractal dimension information;gradual shot change detection;gradual shot transition;gray scale video frames;histogram based shot change detection;pixel based shot change detection;soccer videos;video scene analysis","","0","","21","","","5-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to a previous study, XML documents are mapped to a transactional domain, based on a data representation model which exploits the notion of XML tree tuple. This XML transactional model is well-suited to the identification of semantically cohesive substructures from XML documents, according to structure as well as content information. The proposed clustering framework employs a centroid-based partitional clustering paradigm in a distributed environment. Each peer in the network is allowed to compute a local clustering solution over its own data, then exchanges cluster centroids with other peers. The exchanged centroids correspond to recommendations offered by a peer to peers allowed to compute global representatives. Exploiting these recommendations, each peer becomes responsible for computing a global set of centroids for a given set of clusters. The overall clustering solution is hence computed in a collaborative way according to data from all the peers. Our approach has been evaluated on real XML document collections varying the number of peers. Results have shown that collaborative clustering leads to accurate overall clustering solutions with a relatively low load in the network.","0190-3918;01903918","POD:978-1-4244-4923-1","10.1109/ICPPW.2009.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366138","XML;XML structure and content information;collaborative distributed clustering;transactional data","Collaborative work;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;International collaboration;Parallel processing;Peer to peer computing;Query processing;XML","XML;data structures;groupware;pattern clustering;peer-to-peer computing;trees (mathematics)","XML documents;XML tree tuple;centroid-based partitional clustering;collaborative clustering;data representation;distributed collaborative approach","","1","","18","","","22-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different vocabulary learning methods are employed for comparison. The vocabulary learning method based on theory of depths of processing is proved to be the most effective way for vocabulary learners to enlarge their lexical size and improve their retention rate of vocabulary.","","POD:978-0-7695-3892-1","10.1109/ICCTD.2009.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360196","English vocabulary learning;direct vocabulary learning;indirect vocabulary learning Introduction;theory of depths of processing","Educational institutions;Encoding;Information processing;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Learning systems;Natural languages;Registers;Testing;Vocabulary","computer science education;natural language processing;vocabulary","English sentence;English vocabulary learning system;depths processing theory","","0","","8","","","13-15 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Time-frequency and transient analysis have been widely used in this kind of dynamic signal processing. These methods represent important characteristics of a signal in both time and frequency domain. In this way, essential features of the signal can be viewed and analyzed in order to identify or quantify the detected gases. Very often the fast Fourier transform and the discrete wavelet transform have been used as the dynamic signal processing tools. This work presents the application of a new signal processing technique, empirical mode decomposition and the Hilbert spectrum, in analysis of dynamic response signals of gas sensors. Using EMD method, the dynamic signals were decomposed into the intrinsic modes that coexist in the sensor system, and to have a better understanding of the nature of the gas sensing response information contained in the sensor response signals. The experimental results show that marginal spectrum can be used as useful feature for identification. By this method, the intrinsic response components to the detected gas may be provided and the extracted features are simple and having intrinsic physical meaning.","2156-7379;21567379","POD:978-1-4244-4994-1","10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5366437","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366437","","Discrete wavelet transforms;Fast Fourier transforms;Gas detectors;Information retrieval;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Temperature sensors;Time frequency analysis","Hilbert transforms;gas sensors;signal processing;time-frequency analysis;transient analysis","Hilbert-Huang transform;dynamic signal processing;metal oxide sensors;temperature modulated gas sensor;time-frequency analysis;transient analysis","","0","","8","","","19-20 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To design better mobile information retrieval systems that typically draw information from various sources there is a need for a better understanding of these contextual properties that have an impact of design and delivery of such information. In this paper, we derive a set of 42 context properties and classify them using a model known as TILES (Temporal, Identity, Location, Environmental and Social). These properties were derived from literature in context-related studies, context-aware applications from the mobile tourism industry and augmented with focus group study findings. The TILES model, while having the highest applicability in the mobile tourism industry, can be adapted to other domains and serve as a framework to better aid the design and development of context-aware information retrieval systems in these domains.","","POD:978-1-4244-4253-9","10.1109/ICDIM.2009.5356787","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356787","","Context awareness;Context modeling;Displays;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Office automation;Tiles;Weather forecasting","information retrieval systems;mobile computing;pattern classification","TILES property;context aware application;context properties classification;contextual information;environmental property;identity property;location property;mobile information retrieval system;mobile tourism industry;social property;temporal property","","0","","39","","","1-4 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A skip Tri-Gram is obtained by selecting three segments in the clockwise order while allowing a constant number of segments to be Â¿skippedÂ¿ in between. The main idea is to use skip Tri-Grams of the segments to implicitly encode the distant dependency of the shape. All skip Tri-Grams are used for efficiently retrieving closed contour shapes without pairwise matching feature points from two shapes. The retrieval is at least an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms. We score 80% in the Bullseye retrieval test on the whole MPEG 7 shape dataset.

Experimental results on the DUC-2002 and 20 Newsgroups datasets show that CorSum outperforms other extractive summarization methods, and classification time is significantly reduced using CorSum-generated summaries with compatible accuracy.

Currently search applications have difficulties. 1) Mobile photos have relatively low qualities, and photos contain various affine transforms. The two drawbacks will influence the retrieval accuracy. 2) Retrieval speed and accuracy could not meet a balance for large scale database. Current index mechanism for high dimensional local feature such as SIFT is not fast enough while lots of low dimensional feature cannot ensure high accuracy.

Results could contribute to the understanding of human information processing and cognitive architecture. They could be beneficial for tutoring and student modeling, and may serve as a framework for knowledge-based driven AI agents.","","POD:978-1-4244-5166-1","10.1109/ComputationWorld.2009.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5359630","chess;chunk;information processing;machine learning;procedural knowledge","Artificial intelligence;Computer architecture;Data mining;Humans;Information processing;Information retrieval;Information science;Intelligent systems;Laboratories;Machine learning","cognition;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence)","characteristic descriptions;chess game;cognitive architecture;cognitive behavior;data mining techniques;human information processing;procedural chunks identification;procedural knowledge","","0","","15","","","15-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reduce such costs, dynamic energy management is often employed. However, dynamic energy management, especially that for disks, introduces delays when an accessed disk is in a low power state and needs to be brought into active state. In this paper, we propose system-wide alternative retrieval of data (SARD) that exploits the large number of machines in an enterprise environment to transparently retrieve binaries from other nodes, thus avoiding access delays when the local disk is in a low power mode. SARD uses a software-based approach to reduce spin-up delays while eliminating the need for major operating system changes, custom buffering, or shared memory infrastructure.","1526-7539;15267539","POD:978-1-4244-4927-9","10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366635","","Costs;Delay;Energy consumption;Energy management;File servers;Information retrieval;Memory management;Peer to peer computing;Spinning;Workstations","disc storage;file organisation;peer-to-peer computing;storage management;workstation clusters","access delays;custom buffering;disk energy management delays;dynamic energy management;operating system changes;peer memory;peer-to-peer network;shared memory infrastructure;spin-up delays reduction;system-wide alternative retrieval of data","","1","","9","","","21-23 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While mainstream MME research nowadays relies on audio music analysis, exploring the significance of lyrics text in predicting song emotion is gaining attention in recent years. One major impediment to MME research is the lack of a clearly labeled and publicly available dataset annotating the emotion ratings of lyrics text and audio separately. In light of this, we compiled a dataset of 600 pop songs (iPop) from the mood ratings of 246 participants who experienced three different song sessions, lyrics text (L), audio music track (M), and the combination of lyrics text and audio music track (C). We then applied statistical analysis to estimate how lyrics text and audio contribute to a song's overall valence-arousal (V-A) mood ratings. Our results show that lyrics text are not only a valid measure for estimating a song's mood ratings but also provide supplementary information that can improve audio-only MME systems. Furthermore, a detailed examination suggests that lyrics text (L) ratings are better estimators of the overall mood ratings of a song (C) in cases where L and M ratings conflict. We then construct a MME system that employs both features extracted from lyrics text and audio music track and validate the conclusions acquired in our statistical analysis. In estimating either V or A rating, the model with lyrics text plus audio track features performs better than only the model with only lyrics text or audio track features. These results validate the statement acquired by the statistical analysis.","2156-8103;21568103","POD:978-1-4244-4800-5","10.1109/ACII.2009.5349591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349591","","Computer science;Data mining;Feature extraction;Impedance;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Mood;Music information retrieval;Power engineering and energy;Recommender systems;Statistical analysis","behavioural sciences computing;information retrieval;music;statistical analysis","audio emotion ratings;audio music analysis;audio music track;lyrics text emotion ratings;lyrics text ratings;lyrics textual input;mood-based music recommendation;music mood estimation;song emotion prediction;statistical analysis;valence-arousal mood ratings","","3","","20","","","10-12 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an multi-sphere SVDD approach, named MS-SVDD, for outlier detection on multi-distribution data. First, an adaptive sphere detection method is proposed to detect data distributions in the dataset. The data is partitioned in terms of the identified data distributions, and the corresponding SVDD classifiers are constructed separately.

Finally, we evaluate our methods on the Enterprise corpora provided by Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). Experimental results shows that our strategy brings substantial gains to the expert finding and delivers excellent performance.","","POD:978-1-4244-4754-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358088","","Buildings;Data mining;Databases;Feedback;Information retrieval;Information science;Knowledge management;Performance gain;Personnel;World Wide Web","expert systems;query processing;relevance feedback;text analysis","association building;document evaluation;enterprise corpora;expert finding system;proximity constraints;pseudo relevance feedback;query expansion method;text retrieval conference","","0","","20","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method is based on clustering text snippets including words in focus. Next, for each cluster we found a core, the core is labelled with a word sense by a human and finally is used to produce a classifier. Classifiers, constructed for each word separately, are applied to text.

This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and Web server mechanisms to put them in a Web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements. Additionally we studied the impact of classification threshold on the obtained results.","2157-5525;21575525","POD:978-1-4244-5314-6","10.1109/IMCSIT.2009.5352806","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5352806","","Application software;Computer science;Data security;Databases;Electronic mail;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Web server","Internet;SQL;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;query processing;security of data","SQL;SQL queries;Web browser;Web server mechanism;gene expression programming;intrusion detection;malicious queries","","0","","15","","","12-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an approach to create a set of extraction pattern by combining a particular part of speech (POS) tagger and grammatical parser, i.e. Stanford POS Tagger and Link Grammar Parser (LG). The extraction pattern will be used in a name entity recognition (NER) system to identify the occurrences of some entities in free text documents. We demonstrate the algorithm on accident report as a case study.","","POD:978-0-7695-3892-1","10.1109/ICCTD.2009.227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5359729","Extraction Pattern;Grammatical structure;LG parser;Stanford POS tagger","Accidents;Data mining;Dictionaries;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Pattern analysis;Pattern recognition;Speech analysis;Web pages","computational linguistics;feature extraction;grammars;text analysis","Web page;free text document;grammatical parser;name entity recognition;part-of-speech tagger;pattern extraction;semantic tagger;syntactic analyzer","","1","","13","","","13-15 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first stage consists of eliminating false keypoint matches using symmetric property and a ratio of nearest and second-nearest neighbor distances. Then, a pattern coherency score is assigned to each pair of keyframes. These two features are combined through linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the separating boundary is trained using SVM. Experiments are carried out for NDK retrieval on the Columbia and NTU datasets. The promising results confirm the effectiveness of our keypoint matching algorithm and show distinguishing power of our proposed features and feature weighting role in NDK retrieval.","","POD:978-1-4244-5231-6","10.1109/ISM.2009.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363265","Near-Duplicate keyframe;SIFT keypoints;keypoint matching","Cameras;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Linear discriminant analysis;Nearest neighbor searches;Robustness;Support vector machines;Variable speed drives;Yarn","image matching;image motion analysis;support vector machines;video signal processing","SVM;extreme zooming;feature weighting role;keypoint matching;linear discriminant analysis;near-duplicate keyframe retrieval;object motion;pattern coherency score;second-nearest neighbor distance;symmetric property","","2","","14","","","14-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been mathematically proved that the square-root allocation, in which the ratios of numbers of replicas are proportional to the square-root of their access frequencies, is optimal in terms of search efficiency. In this paper, we propose a replica relocation method that not only nearly achieves the square-root allocation but also distributes replicas uniformly in the network as much as possible. Our method creates replicas at each peer on the path along which a query is successfully forwarded. Here, each peer on the path determines whether it creates the replica or not based on the access frequency of the data item. In addition, for creating a new replica when a cache memory space is full, our method preferentially deletes a replica of a data item which has been replicated at a large number of peers.","","POD:978-1-4244-5084-8","10.1109/AP2PS.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5359160","P2P;access frequency;replica;square-root allocation","Cache memory;Context;Frequency estimation;Information retrieval;Information science;Multimedia systems;Network servers;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Radio spectrum management","peer-to-peer computing","P2P networks;cache memory space;data availability;data item;replica relocation method;search efficiency;square-root allocation","","1","","7","","","11-16 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automatic speech recognizer (ASR) is one of the key modules for voice search systems. However, the high error rate of the state-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) is the bottleneck for most voice search systems. In this paper, we first build a baseline system using language model (LM) with domain-specific information. To improve our system, we propose a forward-backward LVCSR system combination method to decrease the search errors in speech recognition.
