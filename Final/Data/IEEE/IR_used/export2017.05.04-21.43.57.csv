We consider transmission of linearly precoded data symbols over a frequency selective block fading multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless channel. To encompass a number of transmission schemes, we study this problem utilizing affine precoding, which is a unified model of linearly precoded data symbols with superimposed training. We focus on Bayesian receivers that estimate both the unknown fading coefficients and the data symbols. The receiver may adopt either of the following strategies to retrieve the data symbols: strategy (i) the receiver obtains joint Bayesian channel and symbol estimates, strategy, (ii) the receiver obtains a Bayesian channel estimate initially and the channel measurement is utilized to estimate the data symbols. For both strategies, we provide lower bounds on the mutual information between the data symbols and their corresponding estimates, and we relate these bounds to the symbol Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) matrices. In contrast to strategy (ii), for strategy (i) the lower bound does not depend on either the channel estimate or the covariance of the channel estimation error. For strategy (ii) we show that asymptotically (as the size of the transmission block grows) there is no loss of information after the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of Gaussian symbols. We also provide guidelines to design affine precoders that maximize the derived lower bounds under the total average transmit power constraint.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2005.861774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576976","Affine precoding;Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (CRB);Bayesian estimator;Fisher information matrix;MIMO systems;block transmission;mutual information","Bayesian methods;Channel estimation;Covariance matrix;Cramer-Rao bounds;Estimation error;Fading;Frequency;Information retrieval;MIMO;Mutual information","MIMO systems;channel coding;channel estimation;fading channels;maximum likelihood estimation;precoding;radio receivers;wireless channels","Bayesian channel;Bayesian receivers;Cramer-Rao bounds;Gaussian symbols;channel estimation;channel mutual information;frequency selective block fading multiple input multiple output wireless channel;linearly precoded data symbols;maximum a posteriori estimation;receiver estimation error","","21","","39","","","Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Though several approaches can deal with this situation, none of them aims directly at knowledge management or organizational memory creation. In this paper we capitalize on earlier divergent information management approaches, presenting a divergent information model, based on information structuring rather than locking mechanisms over shared resources, as a means for reinforcing the connection between distributed collaboration, decision-making and knowledge management, by enhancing document expressiveness (its persistence and linking). We then use this model as a basis for a computer-supported system to handle divergent information and present detected problems and guidelines for future research.","1530-1605;15301605","POD:0-7695-2507-5","10.1109/HICSS.2006.264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1579320","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Distributed decision making;Environmental economics;Environmental management;Information management;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Memory management;Resource management","","","","1","","47","","","04-07 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sci., Michigan Univ., Ann Arbor, MI, USA","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","20060130","2006","18","3","350","362","In many advanced applications, data are described by multiple high-dimensional features. Moreover, different queries may weight these features differently; some may not even specify all the features. In this paper, we propose our solution to support efficient query processing in these applications. We devise a novel representation that compactly captures f features into two components. The first component is a 2D vector that reflects a distance range (minimum and maximum values) of the f features with respect to a reference point (the center of the space) in a metric space and the second component is a bit signature, with two bits per dimension, obtained by analyzing each feature's descending energy histogram. This representation enables two levels of filtering: the first component prunes away points that do not share similar distance ranges, while the bit signature filters away points based on the dimensions of the relevant features. Moreover, the representation facilitates the use of a single index structure to further speed up processing. We employ the classical B<sup>+</sup>-tree for this purpose. We also propose a KNN search algorithm that exploits the access orders of critical dimensions of highly selective features and partial distances to prune the search space more effectively. Our extensive experiments on both real-life and synthetic data sets show that the proposed solution offers significant performance advantages over sequential scan and retrieval methods using single and multiple VA-files.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1583584","Index Terms- Multifeature;high-dimensional;indexing;query processing;weighted query.","Application software;Computer Society;Energy capture;Filtering;Functional analysis;Histograms;Indexing;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Query processing","database indexing;query processing;tree searching;trees (mathematics)","2D vector;B<sup>+</sup>-tree;KNN search algorithm;bit signature;index structure;multifeature query processing","","2","","10","","","March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the complicated and dynamic characteristics of grid resources make sharing and discovering them a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) based overlay network to assist the efficient resource discovery and query. The framework is based on the RDF metadata infrastructure, allowing a rich and extensible description of resources. To avoid flooding the network with a query, we propose a comprehensive semantics-based query forwarding strategy, which only forwards queries to semantically related nodes. After the related nodes have been located, the original RDF query is used to do the final query and retrieval.

The approach attempts to highlight the consistency of one-dimensional models and linear mixture approaches. DISMA combines spectral signatures of soil and vegetation components with an analytical approximation of the radiative transfer equation, giving rise to a fast invertible bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model of discontinuous canopies. Both the forward model and its inversion using a simple technique based on lookup tables method are tested using airborne POLDER and HyMap data corresponding to cropland. The method has proven fast enough to image vegetation properties over large areas, providing accurate and stable maps of FVC and LAI. The retrievals of LAI correspond well with ground-based measurements of specific crops, with root mean square error differences of 0.5-0.6 and a r<sup>2</sup> of the linear fitting around 0.92. Though the accuracy assessment of retrieved parameters may be sensitive to the BRDF sampling, the results of model inversion remain consistent when varying the angular and spectral configurations. A model intercomparison exercise has been carried out using different models, either purely descriptive or based on radiative transfer modeling, indicating that this general approach is both sound and consistent. Thus, DISMA appears to be a useful tool for exploiting the synergistic spectral and angular potential of the new sensors.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.861008","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580722","Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF);HyMap;Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance (POLDER);fractional vegetation cover (FVC);inversion;leaf area index (LAI);spectral mixture analysis (SMA)","Bidirectional control;Crops;Distribution functions;Equations;Information retrieval;Soil;Spectral analysis;Table lookup;Testing;Vegetation mapping","data acquisition;geophysical signal processing;image processing;inverse problems;radiative transfer;soil;spectral analysis;vegetation mapping","Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance;airborne HyMap data;airborne POLDER data;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;cropland;directional spectral mixture analysis;discontinuous canopy;fractional vegetation cover;inverse problem;leaf area index;linear fitting;lookup tables;multiangular airborne measurement;multiangular data;multispectral data;radiative transfer equation;root mean square error;soil components;spectral signature;vegetation components;vegetation imaging;vegetation parameter retrieval","","6","","71","","","Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Second, to access information on a particular website the languages offered are an even more important factor than network effects: non-native speakers and links from websites in other languages are always underrepresented.

The methods were developed and are mostly applied for periodic signals under the assumption that only harmonics are present and the periodicity intervals are fixed, while periodicity intervals in the presence of interharmonics are variable and very long. A novel approach to harmonic and interharmonic analysis based on the ""subspace"" methods is proposed. Min-norm and music harmonic retrieval methods are examples of high-resolution eigenstructure-based methods. Their resolution is theoretically independent of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The Prony method as applied for parameter estimation of signal components was also tested in the paper. Both the high-resolution methods do not show the disadvantages of the traditional tools and allow exact estimation of the interharmonic frequencies. To investigate the methods, several experiments were carried out using simulated signals, current waveforms at the output of an industrial frequency converter, and current waveforms during out-of-step operation of a synchronous generator. For comparison, similar experiments were repeated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT).

A variety of humanlike robot hands have been constructed, but it remains difficult to control these hands in a dexterous way. One challenge is grasp synthesis, where we wish to place the hand and control its shape to successfully grasp a given object. In this paper, we present a datadriven approach to grasp synthesis that treats grasping as a shape matching problem. We begin with a database of grasp examples.

In cases where the query sources are limited to a number of fixed points in the network, we propose a query source adaptation policy to reduce network stress on overlay links.

Due to its huge size however, finding relevant information without any appropriate tool can be virtually impossible. Web document clustering is one possible technique to improve the efficiency in information finding process. In this paper, we are looking into fuzzy co-clustering, which is known to be robust for clustering standard text documents. In our opinion, its robustness can also be extended to Web documents because it can generate descriptive clusters in high dimension and it is able to discover data clusters with overlaps. We consider two existing fuzzy co-clustering algorithms, FCCM and fuzzy Codok. In addition, we propose a new algorithm, FCC-STF, as an alternative to the existing ones. Empirical study of these algorithms on benchmark datasets is presented, together with the performance comparison with a standard fuzzy clustering algorithm HFCM. The results show that fuzzy co-clustering is generally superior to standard fuzzy clustering in the Web environment, making it a technique with great potential to assist Internet user in discovering relevant information effectively","","POD:0-7695-2378-1","10.1109/CW.2005.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587593","","Clustering algorithms;Costs;Databases;History;Information retrieval;Internet;Robustness","Internet;document handling;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering","Internet;Web document clustering;fuzzy Codok;fuzzy coclustering with single term fuzzifier;hierarchical fuzzy c-means;information finding process","","0","1","11","","","23-25 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm integrates predictions of experts trained on clusters of heterogeneous collections of data. It combines predictions of the modular ensemble of classifiers by identifying hierarchical votes for most similar classes. Experimental results show better performances than individual global models. Relationships between some visual arts patterns are inferred. We also compare the results obtained for few fusion versions of our algorithm with other methods applied on IRIS and Glass benchmarks.

The nowadays popular discriminative (classification, machine learning, statistical forecasting etc.) approaches have been mostly abandoned while solving this task in spite of their success in a different task of text categorization. In this paper, we studied if a classifier can be trained solely based on labeled examples to successfully generalize to new (unseen by the system) queries and provide performance comparable with popular heuristic or language models. Our SVM-based classifier learns from the relevance judgments available with the standard test collections and generalizes to new, previously unseen queries its ability to compare and rank documents with respect to a given query. To accomplish this, we have designed a representation scheme, which is based on the discretized form of the high level statistics of the query term occurrences (such as tf, df, and document length) rather than individual terms. Using the standard metrics of average precision and the standard large and small test collections we confirmed that our machine learning approach can achieve the performance comparable with and better than the performance of the current state of the art models.","1530-1605;15301605","POD:0-7695-2507-5","10.1109/HICSS.2006.252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1579395","","Appropriate technology;Information retrieval;Information systems;Machine learning;Management training;Space technology;Statistics;Support vector machines;Testing;Text categorization","","","","0","","19","","","04-07 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The server reconstructs the current contents of the document by combining the text lines based on the document structure information. The server analyzes the reconstructed document contents, and evaluates the conformity of preserved guidance generation rules to select appropriate ones. From the selected rules, guidance information is generated and is sent back to the word processor.

The algorithms developed are suited for ocean SAR data, which were acquired at the C band of either vertical (VV) or horizontal (HH) polarization in transmission and reception. Wind directions are extracted from wind-induced streaks that are visible in SAR images of the ocean at horizontal scales greater than 200 m. These wind streaks are very well aligned with the mean surface wind direction. To extract the orientation of these streaks, two algorithms are introduced, which are applied either in the spatial or spectral domain. Ocean surface wind speeds are derived from the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) and image geometry of the calibrated SAR images, together with the local SAR-retrieved wind direction. Therefore, several C-band models (CMOD IFR2, CMOD4, and CMODS) are available, which were developed for VV polarization, and have to be extended for HH polarization. To compare the different algorithms and C-band models as well as demonstrate their applicability, SAR-retrieved wind fields are compared to numerical-model results considering advanced SAR (ASAR) data from Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT), a European satellite.","0364-9059;03649059","","10.1109/JOE.2005.857514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593798","Ocean winds;polarization ratio (PR);radar backscatter;remote sensing;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Data mining;Information retrieval;Oceans;Polarization;Radar cross section;Satellites;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Synthetic aperture radar;Wind speed","atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric techniques;meteorological radar;ocean waves;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;wind","C band;SAR;ocean surface winds;polarization;synthetic aperture radars;wind directions;wind streaks","","53","","32","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While inner-product based similarity measures consider only positive matches, other conventional measures credit both positive and negative matches equally. Hence, we propose an enhanced similarity measure that gives variable credits and show that it is superior to conventional measures in an offline handwritten character recognition application.

The aim of the technique is to dynamically generate a context-based measure of document term significance during retrieval that can be used as a substitute or co-contributor of the term frequency measure. Unlike term frequency, which relies on a term to occur multiple times within a document to be considered significant, context matching is based on the notion that if a term in a given document occurs in that document in the context of the query, then that term is deemed to be significant. Context matching has the ability to potentially determine a term to be significant even if it occurs only once in a large document. The proposed technique has been implemented and the experiments were conducted using a TREC benchmark database. A comparative analysis shows that context matching significantly improves retrieval effectiveness and outperforms previously published results.","1520-5363;15205363","POD:0-7695-2420-6","10.1109/ICDAR.2005.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1575676","","Australia;Data analysis;Data mining;Databases;Frequency measurement;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Web sites;World Wide Web","Internet;document handling;information retrieval;pattern matching","TREC benchmark database;Web document retrieval;context matching","","0","","17","","","29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The principle used for switching detection is based on finding projected subspaces from batches of input-output data, which are taken from the full data set. The method runs off-line, incrementally over all the data and, at each time, a different batch is used to compute the projected subspace. In this way, the segmentation and classification of data are entirely based on the information retrieved from the projected subspace, i.e. the subspace dimension and basis. The output of the method is a matrix of weights that assigns each pair of input-output measured data to the respective local system.

To interact with XML-IR systems, users must express both their content and structural requirement, in the form of a structured query. Traditionally, these structured queries have been formatted using formal languages such as XPath or NEXI. Unfortunately, formal query languages are very complex and too difficult to be used by experienced, let alone casual users. Therefore, recent research has investigated the idea of specifying users' content and structural needs via natural language queries (NLQs). In previous research we developed NLPX, a natural language interface to an XML-IR system. Here we present additions we have made to NLPX. The additions involve the application of transformation-based error-driven learning (TBL) to structured NLQs, to derive special connotations and group words into an atomic unit of information. TBL has successfully been applied to other areas of natural language processing; however, this paper presents the first time it has been applied to structured NLQs. Here, we investigate the applicability of TBL to NLQs and compare the TBL-based system, with our previous system and a system with a formal language interference.

This is problematic for users since no one IR system works best for every scenario, and it is difficult for the user to know which system will work best a priori. The challenge of metasearch is to merge results lists from several IR systems, with the goal of outperforming each of the constituent systems. This paper presents ComRank, a metasearch system that discriminates in favour of results that (1) originate by consensus amongst several systems; (2) are highly ranked in their original systems and (3) originate from the better performing systems. Importantly, ComRank determines the `better' performing systems without the need for human judgements. Rather, it uses an automatic assessment process that ranks systems by their pseudo-relevance, as derived from highly ranked results in ComRank's list. We apply our methods to the INEX Collection, which is an unexplored domain for these methods, and show that they are comparable to or better than baseline alternatives","","POD:0-7695-2378-1","10.1109/CW.2005.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587528","","Abstracts;Automatic control;Data communication;Humans;Information retrieval;Information technology;Metasearch;Software engineering;Web sites;XML","XML;information retrieval systems;relevance feedback","ComRank;INEX Collection;XML retrieval system ranking;automatic assessment;information retrieval system;metasearch;pseudorelevance","","0","","27","","","23-25 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, the application of the theory of TMS on new product development teams is surprisingly scant. We argue that the TMS leverages the notion of project-team memory, which is mostly equated with mechanistic memory or electronic documents and databases, by facilitating an interpersonal awareness of who knows what and who has appropriate and adequate skills and expertise, and then receiving information from that person. We then empirically test the effects of TMS on new product development outcomes including mediating and moderating factors, i.e., the collective mind and environmental turbulence, respectively. By investigating 79 Turkish new product development project teams, we found that: 1) the TMS has a positive impact on team learning and speed-to-market; 2) the collective mind (i.e., team members' attention to interrelating actions) mediates relations between the TMS, team learning, and speed-to-market; and 3) team learning and speed-to-market mediates relations between the TMS and new product success. Further, the moderating effect of environmental turbulence is investigated between the TMS, and team learning and speed-to-market. We found that the impact of the TMS on: 1) speed-to-market is negative when market and technology turbulence associated with the environment is high and 2) team learning changes quadratically with respect to the market and technology turbulence. Theoretical and managerial implications of the study findings are discussed.","0018-9391;00189391","","10.1109/TEM.2005.857570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580897","Collective memory;collective mind;new product development;team learning;transactive memory system (TMS)","Cognition;Consumer electronics;Databases;Information retrieval;Memory management;Product development;Psychology;Technological innovation;Technology management;Testing","knowledge management;product development;project management","electronic databases;electronic documents;environmental turbulence;group behavior literature;group research;interpersonal awareness;managerial implications;mechanistic memory;product development;project-team memory;speed-to-market;team learning;transactive memory system","","67","","110","","","Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We show how domain-specific knowledge, in conjunction with semantic Web services, can be used to improve situational awareness in the operational deployment of humanitarian operations, especially when such operations occur against a contextual backdrop of ongoing military conflict. Information, harvested from a variety of physically disparate and semantically heterogeneous data sources, is used to establish a common repository of semantically rich, conceptual-level representations of real-world events. Reasoning services, deployed over the knowledge repository, are used to intelligently fuse information, taking into account factors such as the level of trust and confidence assigned to specific information sources. Selective attention to information of relevance to particular users helps avoid situations of information overload that might otherwise result from the information fusion process. We believe this approach to have general applicability in a wide variety of military contexts.","","POD:0-7803-9286-8","10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1591969","decision support;humanitarian relief;information fusion;knowledge-based systems;ontologies;semantic web;situational awareness","Computer science;Context awareness;Context-aware services;Fuses;Information retrieval;Knowledge based systems;Logistics;Modems;Ontologies;Semantic Web","knowledge based systems;military computing;relevance feedback;semantic Web","conceptual-level representation;domain-specific knowledge;heterogeneous data resource;humanitarian operation deployment;information relevance;knowledge-based information fusion;military conflict;reasoning service;semantic Web service;situational awareness","","5","","23","","","25-28 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Inversion of a lidar waveform model for forest biophysical parameter estimation","B. Koetz; F. Morsdorf; G. Sun; K. J. Ranson; K. Itten; B. Allgower","Remote Sensing Labs., Univ. of Zurich, Switzerland","IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","20060116","2006","3","1","49","53","Due to its measurement principle, light detection and ranging (lidar) is particularly suited to estimate the horizontal as well as vertical distribution of forest structure. Quantification and characterization of forest structure is important for the understanding of the forest ecosystem functioning and, moreover, will help to assess carbon sequestration within forests. The relationship between the signal recorded by a lidar system and the canopy structure of a forest can be accurately characterized by physically based radiative transfer models (RTMs). A three-dimensional RTM is capable of representing the complex forest canopy structure as well as the involved physical processes of the lidar pulse interactions with the vegetation. Consequently, the inversion of such an RTM presents a novel concept to retrieve biophysical forest parameters that exploits the full lidar signal and underlying physical processes. A synthetic dataset and data acquired in the Swiss National Park (SNP) successfully demonstrated the feasibility and the potential of RTM inversion to retrieve forest structure from large-footprint lidar waveform data. The SNP lidar data consist of waveforms generated from the aggregation of small-footprint lidar returns. Derived forest biophysical parameters, such as fractional cover, leaf area index, maximum tree height, and the vertical crown extension, were able to describe the horizontal and vertical forest canopy structure.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2005.856706","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576688","Biophysical parameters;fcover;inversion;leaf area index (LAI);light detection and ranging (lidar) waveform;three-dimensional (3-D) model;tree height","Biomass;Ecosystems;Information retrieval;Laser radar;Light scattering;Parameter estimation;Pulse measurements;Remote sensing;Sun;Vegetation mapping","forestry;geophysical signal processing;optical radar;vegetation;vegetation mapping","Swiss National Park;biophysical forest parameters;canopy structure;carbon sequestration;forest biophysical parameter estimation;forest ecosystem functioning;forest structure characterization;forest structure quantification;forest structure vertical distribution;fractional cover;leaf area index;lidar waveform model;light detection and ranging;maximum tree height;radiative transfer models;vegetation;vertical crown extension","","40","","21","","","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

P2P networks are highly scalable platforms, which should be suitable for personal digital library, but the contradiction between efficiency and autonomy holds back their progress in applying them to DL. In this paper, we propose an autonomous flexible content addressable network (Flexible CAN), in which nodes can change their position freel. Flexible CAN has the advantages of both efficiency and autonomy. It can be used not only for information managing and retrieving, but also autonomic detect group of users with the same interest. Thus the group becomes a community, and users can share their resources and experiences conveniently.","2379-5352;23795352","POD:0-7695-2405-2","10.1109/PDCAT.2005.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1579033","","Computer networks;Conference management;Distributed computing;Information management;Information retrieval;Information technology;Postal services;Scalability;Software libraries;Technology management","","","","1","","10","","","05-08 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Fast optical character recognition through glyph hashing for document conversion","K. Chellapilla; P. Simard; R. Nickolov","Microsoft Res., Redmond, WA, USA","Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","20060116","2005","","","829","833 Vol. 2","This paper proposes a glyph hashing approach to optical character recognition with applications in document conversion. The viability and efficiency of the approach is tested through its implementation in a print driver on 68,987 PDF documents containing 1.15 billion characters. Results indicate that a hash table with (a) 3.2 million hashes is sufficient to represent all characters from these documents, and (b) 480 fonts are sufficient to cover over 90% of these documents. Glyph recognizing experiments indicate that 80% of unique character glyphs and over 96% of all characters from unseen documents can be found in a hash table built using all 68,987 documents. The hashing approach is used to not only recognize the character codes but also, size, style (bold, italic, etc), and font name. We found that the hashing approach can scale to hundreds of fonts and thousands of characters per font. Further, it is extremely fast and can recognize over 100,000 characters per second. Owing to its speed, such a hashing approach can complement any existing OCR system by acting as a pre-filter to produce a 4-5 times speedup during document conversion.","1520-5363;15205363","POD:0-7695-2420-6","10.1109/ICDAR.2005.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1575661","","Character recognition;Displays;Image converters;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Optical character recognition software;Optical distortion;Testing;Text processing","character sets;document image processing;optical character recognition;table lookup","PDF document;character glyph;document conversion;glyph hashing;hash table;optical character recognition","","2","","6","","","29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In principle, one can then audit, validate, reproduce, and/or re-run with corrections various data transformations. We have recently proposed and prototyped the Chimera virtual data system, a new database-driven approach to this problem. We present here a major application study in which we apply Chimera to a challenging data analysis problem: the identification of galaxy clusters within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We describe the problem, its computational procedures, and the use of Chimera to plan and orchestrate the workflow of thousands of tasks on a data grid comprising hundreds of computers. This experience suggests that a general set of tools can indeed enhance the accuracy and productivity of scientific data reduction and that further development and application of this paradigm will offer great value.","1063-9535;10639535","POD:0-7695-1524-X","10.1109/SC.2002.10021","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592892","","Astrophysics;Catalogs;Clustering algorithms;Collaboration;Computer science;Data systems;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Information retrieval;Mathematics","","","","16","7","25","","","16-22 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
