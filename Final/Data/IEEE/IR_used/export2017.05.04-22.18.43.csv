Most of current approaches for text summarization do not make full use of human reading process. This paper proposes a multi-document scanning mechanism by simulating human reading process. The mechanism simulates human memory of words, association between words and three cognitive processes invoked when reading. Changes of human memory of topic words in reading process are used to denote sentences' significance, based on which sentences are then ordered and extracted to form a summary. Experiments on DUC2007 test data show that our proposing method is efficient and outperforms two baseline methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3012-8; POD:978-1-4799-3013-5","10.1109/SKG.2013.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816610","cognitive;human reading process;summarization","Artificial intelligence;Computational linguistics;Computational modeling;Equations;Mathematical model;Natural language processing;Semantics","information retrieval;natural language processing;text analysis","automatic text summarization;cognitive-based multidocument summarization approach;human reading process;information retrieval;multidocument scanning mechanism;natural language processing","","0","","30","","","3-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ontology Population (OP) concerns both the extraction and classification of instances of the concepts and relations defined by an ontology. Developing IE rules for OP is an intensive and time-consuming process. Thus, an automated mechanism, based on machine-learning techniques, able to convert textual data from web pages into ontology instances may be a crucial path. This paper presents an inductive logic programming-based method that automatic induces symbolic extraction rules, which are used for populating a domain ontology with instances of entity classes. This method uses domain-independent linguistic patterns for retrieving candidate instances from web pages, and a WordNet semantic similarity measure as background knowledge to be used as input by a generic inductive logic programming system. Experiments were conducted concerning both the instance classification problem and a comparison with other popular machine learning algorithms, with encouraging results.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3188-0; POD:978-1-4799-3189-7","10.1109/ITNG.2014.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822242","Inductive Logic Programming;Information Extraction;Ontology Population;Pattern Learning","Feature extraction;Logic programming;Ontologies;Semantics;Sociology;Statistics","Internet;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);logic programming;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","IE solutions;OP;Web content processing;Web pages;WordNet semantic similarity measure;background knowledge;candidate instances retrieval;domain-independent linguistic patterns;entity classes;generic inductive logic programming system;information extraction;information overload problem;instance classification problem;machine-learning techniques;ontology population;symbolic extraction rules;textual data","","0","","24","","","7-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When such a response is detected, our previously developed system automatically places a bookmark in the audio stream for later resumption of listening. Here, we investigate two uses of haptic feedback to support this implicit interaction and mitigate effects of noisy (false-positive) bookmarking: (a) low-attention notification when a bookmark is placed, and (b) focused-attention display of bookmarks during resumptive navigation. Results show that haptic notification of bookmark placement, when paired with visual display of bookmark location, significant improves navigation time. Solely visual or haptic display of bookmarks elicited equivalent navigation time; however, only the inclusion of haptic display significantly increased accuracy. Participants preferred haptic notification over no notification at interruption time, and combined haptic and visual display of bookmarks to support navigation to their interrupted location at resumption time. Our contributions include an approach to handling noisy data in implicit HCI, an implementation of haptic notifications that signal implicit system behavior, and discussion of user mental models that may be active in this context.","1939-1412;19391412","","10.1109/TOH.2014.2309124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750756","Haptic I/O;browsing;human-centered computing;low-attention interfaces;multimodal user interfaces;notifications;user/machine systems","Context;Haptic interfaces;Human computer interaction;Navigation;Noise measurement;Physiology;Visualization","audio streaming;haptic interfaces;human computer interaction;information retrieval","audio stream listening use case;bookmark location;bookmark placement;electrodermal activity monitoring;focused-attention display;haptic display;haptic feedback;haptic notification;implicit HCI-based bookmarking;implicit human-computer interaction;implicit interaction;low-attention notification;noisy bookmarking;resumptive navigation;user mental models;visual display","0","0","","59","","20140228","Jan.-March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The method is efficient and precise, however, because of the adopted classical K-means algorithm, it cannot deal with weibo corpus with increasing size. In this paper, a modified version is presented to eliminate the limitation by incorporating incremental clustering mechanism. Based on the weibo characteristics, a new similarity measure is introduced, which takes into considerations the relevance of the recently identified unknown words. With this measure, the categories evolution is reasonably carried out in the process of incremental clustering to ensure the balance between the consistency and timeliness of the method.

First, it is very costly to capture the experience of experts for the complex task of cyber analysis using traditional approaches such as protocol analysis. Second, it is difficult to identify previous experiences of experts that are relevant to the dynamic context of an analyst's cyber analysis task. To address the first challenge, a system has been developed to capture non-intrusively the analytical reasoning processes of analysts. To tackle the second challenge, this paper presents an effective and efficient approach for retrieving relevant experiences based on the dynamically changing context of cyber analysis. We define an experience as a process of analytical reasoning and adopt an Action-Observation-Hypothesis (A-O-H) model to represent the processes in cyber analysis. Based on this model, a tool for capturing and supporting the analytical reasoning processes is shown to be able to support the elusive cognitive process in dynamic cyber situations. The experience retrieval approach of this paper supports the efficient experience retrieval, and dynamically updates the results as the context of analysis evolves.

This Forum Crawler overcomes the drawbacks of many of the existing Forum Crawlers. It has the ability to detect the Entry URL of a Forum site, given any page of it. Crawling process starting from Entry URL increases the coverage. Different URLs in the Web Forums are classified into four categories and our Forum Crawler is capable of detecting these URLs even if they are JavaScript-based which most of the existing Forum Crawlers cannot do. The entire process is divided into learning part and online crawling part. The learning part classifies different URLs in the forum site into four categories: Index URL, Thread URL, Index-Page-Turning URL and Thread-Page-Turning URL. This Forum Crawler uses a Freshness First Strategy rather than the BFS (Breadth First Strategy) for performing online crawling which is advantageous in situations where there are limited system resources available.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2494-3; POD:978-1-4799-2495-0","10.1109/CSCITA.2014.6839264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6839264","JavaScript-based URLs;URL type;crawling strategy;forum crawling;page classification","Crawlers;Indexes;Information technology;Internet;Kernel;Web pages","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval;tree searching","BFS;Entry URL;Internet forum crawler;JavaScript-based URLs;Web Forum crawling;Web forum crawler;breadth first strategy;focused crawler;forum site;freshness first strategy;generic deep Web crawler;index URL;index-page-turning URL;information requesting;information sharing;online crawling;thread URL;thread-page-turning URL","","0","","14","","","4-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this research, the focus is on how to transform pairwise based results to the original ratings. Particularly, an integer linear programming model is formulated for this problem. In this algorithm, the objective is to minimize the number of conflicts for the predicted pairwise based relationship between instances by the assignment of rating values.

"Automatic generation of question answer pairs from noisy case logs","J. Ajmera; S. Joshi; A. Verma; A. Mittal","IBM India Res. Lab., New Delhi, India","2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on Data Engineering","20140519","2014","","","436","447","In a customer support scenario, a lot of valuable information is recorded in the form of `case logs'. Case logs are primarily written for future references or manual inspections and therefore are written in a hasty manner and are very noisy. In this paper, we propose techniques that exploit these case logs to mine real customer concerns or problems and then map them to well written knowledge articles for that enterprise. This mapping results into generation of question-answer (QA) pairs. These QA pairs can be used for a variety of applications such as dynamically updating the frequently-asked-questions (FAQs), updating the knowledge repository etc. In this paper we show the utility of these discovered QA pairs as training data for a question-answering system. Our approach for mining the case logs is based on a composite model consisting of two generative models, viz, hidden Markov model (HMM) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. The LDA model explains the long-range dependencies across words due to their semantic similarity and HMM models the sequential patterns present in these case logs. Such processing results in crisp `problem statement' segments which are indicative of the real customer concerns. Our experiments show that this approach finds crisp problem-statements in 56% of the cases and outperforms other alternate methods for segmentation such as HMM, LDA and conditional random field (CRF). After finding these crisp problem-statements, appropriate answers are looked up from an existing knowledge repository index forming candidate QA pairs. We show that considering only the problemstatement segments for which the answers can be found further improves the segmentation performance to 82%. Finally, we show that when these QA pairs are used as training data, the performance of a question-answering system can be improved significantly.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4799-2555-1; POD:978-1-4799-2556-8; USB:978-1-4799-2554-4","10.1109/ICDE.2014.6816671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816671","","Context;Hidden Markov models;Noise measurement;Semantics;Syntactics;Training;Viterbi algorithm","data mining;hidden Markov models;question answering (information retrieval)","FAQ;HMM;LDA model;QA pairs discovery;case logs mining;conditional random field;frequently-asked-questions;hidden Markov model;knowledge repository;latent Dirichlet allocation model;problem statement segments;question answer pairs;question-answering system;segmentation performance;semantic similarity","","0","","15","","","March 31 2014-April 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sentence scoring is the technique most used for extractive text summarization, today. Depending on the context, however, some techniques may yield better results than some others. This paper advocates the thesis that the quality of the summary obtained with combinations of sentence scoring methods depend on text subject.

It is particularly challenging, however, to achieve high performance of on-demand data retrieval in sparse vehicular networks. Data replication based on random linear network coding can solve the coupon collection problem but suffers the problem of unnecessary data replications which waste the precious communication opportunities of sparse vehicular networks. With real traces we reveal the existence of community structures in vehicular networks, which causes excessive linearly correlated blocks. Motivated by the important observation, we propose a community-aware data replication scheme based on random linear network coding. To reduce the excessive correlated coded blocks because of community structures, we make probabilistic control on the data replication phase, taking the community structures into account. It is demonstrated through extensive simulations that the community-aware scheme can effectively save up to 50% communication opportunities whiling achieving high performance of on-demand data retrieval.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4799-1353-4; POD:978-1-4799-1351-0; USB:978-1-4799-1352-7","10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6831136","Community-aware;Data Replication;Network Coding;Sparse Vehicular Networks","Ad hoc networks;Communities;Decoding;Delays;Network coding;Probabilistic logic;Vehicles","information retrieval;linear codes;network coding;probability;replicated databases","communication opportunities;community structures;community-aware data replication;coupon collection problem;data replication phase;excessive correlated coded blocks;large-scale urban sensing;linearly correlated blocks;on-demand data retrieval;probabilistic control;random linear network coding;sparse vehicular networks","","0","","14","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But most of these algorithms calculate semantic similarity in their own way without taking other factors into account. This paper proposes a novel algorithm which combines three factors mentioned above. To avoid unreasonable artificial weight setting, the principal component analysis is used to weigh each factor's contribution to the semantic similarity.

Relying on these observations, we develop algorithms to detect robust multi-variate temporal (RMT) features which can be indexed for efficient and accurate retrieval and can be used for supporting analysis tasks, such as classification.

Based on an ontology of domain, the approach permits to retrieve compatible solutions rather than similar ones using a model of designer preferences.

A GIS is a computer application that acquire, manipulate, manage, model and visualize geo-referenced data. The goal of a Geo-MOOC is to expand the culture of spatial thinking and the use of geographic information, enabling geospatial web technologies for widespread use. However, the Geo-MOOCs, by nature, have inherent problems of accessibility. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), Article 24, recognize the right of persons with disabilities to education. “States Parties must ensure that persons with disabilities are able to access general tertiary education, vocational training, adult education and lifelong learning without discrimination and on an equal basis with others” [1]. Therefore, it is important to have accessible Geo-MOOCs. In this paper, we present the results of the evaluation of a Geo-MOOC called “Maps and the Geospatial Revolution” using three tools available for free on the Internet: Chrome Developer Tools - Accessibility Audit, eXaminator and WAVE; and included a selection of web content and geographical data representative of the course.

The knowledge workers tend to get de-motivated due to the mundane nature of maintenance tasks assigned to them. To tackle this problem, many organizations are willing to experiment with novel methods of work allocation that provide certain amount of autonomy to the knowledge workers by enabling them to choose what they want to work on. In this paper, we propose a method of work allocation that provides opportunities to employees to choose their work without the organization having to compromise on the regular business tasks. The idea is to use crowdsourcing concepts for the tasks that will enable employees to showcase their skills and talent. We have modeled crowdsourced cum managerial assignments , which we call Hybridsourcing, as an auction mechanism and use game theoretic analysis for studying the competition among players and the tradeoffs for the organization. As part of the auction mechanism for carrying out Hybridsourcing, two games have been formulated based on: 1) players have common knowledge about the operation costs and 2) operation costs are a private information. We show the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium (NE) in both the cases and provide an algorithm bounded by polynomial complexity in order to compute the NE. The outcome of the mechanism is defined by the unique NE. Furthermore, we study the pros and cons of our mechanism vis-a-vis the popular auction based mechanisms like VCG and few others.

The massive amount of data available and the fact that it is fragmented across many services (e.g., Facebook) and devices (e.g., laptop) make it very difficult for users to find specific pieces of information that they remember having stored or accessed. Unifying this fragmented data into a single data set that includes contextual information would allow for much better indexing and searching of personal information. Thus, we have developed a personal data extraction tool as a first step toward this vision. In this paper, we present this extraction tool, along with some preliminary statistics about personal data gathered by the tool for several users. The goal of the data analysis is to give a glimpse of what the digital life of a person may look like, and how it is currently partitioned across many different services; moreover, it reinforces the fact that it is not possible for users to manually retrieve, store and access their extensive digital data without the support of a personalized information management tool.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3481-2; POD:978-1-4799-3482-9","10.1109/ICDEW.2014.6818307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6818307","","Data mining;Data models;Databases;Electronic mail;Facebook;Google;Knowledge discovery","data handling;information retrieval;storage management","Facebook;contextual information;data record;digital storage;personal data extraction;personal information indexing;personal information searching;personalized information management tool","","1","","7","","","March 31 2014-April 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main objective of our study is to propose an new approach for load balancing which can balance the incoming requests from global users which reside in different geographical locations to retrieve the information from a distributed data sources using effective scheduling and virtualization techniques.

"Semantic Stability and Implicit Consensus in Social Tagging Streams","C. Wagner; P. Singer; M. Strohmaier; B. Huberman","Univ. of Koblenz, Koblenz, Germany","IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems","20140603","2014","1","1","108","120","One potential disadvantage of social tagging systems is that due to the lack of a centralized vocabulary, a crowd of users may never manage to reach a consensus on the description of resources (e.g., books, images, users, or songs) on the Web. Yet, previous research has provided interesting evidence that the tag distributions of resources in social tagging systems may become semantically stable over time, as more and more users tag them and implicitly agree on the relative importance of tags for a resource. At the same time, previous work has raised an array of new questions such as: 1) how can we assess semantic stability in a robust and methodical way? 2) does the semantic stabilization varies across different social tagging systems and ultimately, and 3) what are the factors that can explain semantic stabilization in such systems? In this work, we tackle these questions by: 1) presenting a novel and robust method, which overcomes a number of limitations in existing methods; 2) empirically investigating semantic stabilization in different social tagging systems with distinct domains and properties; and 3) detecting potential causes of stabilization and implicit consensus, specifically imitation behavior, shared background knowledge and intrinsic properties of natural language. Our results show that tagging streams that are generated by a combination of imitation dynamics and shared background knowledge exhibit faster and higher semantic stability than tagging streams that are generated via imitation dynamics or natural language phenomena alone.","2329-924X;2329924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2014.2307455","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816015","Distributional semantics;emergent semantics;social semantics;social tagging;stabilization process","Natural languages;Robustness;Semantics;Stability analysis;Tagging;Twitter;Vocabulary","information retrieval;natural language processing","centralized vocabulary;imitation dynamics;implicit consensus;natural language phenomena;semantic stability;semantic stabilization;social tagging systems","","0","","34","","20140516","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Fast incremental SimRank on link-evolving graphs","W. Yu; X. Lin; W. Zhang","Univ. of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia","2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on Data Engineering","20140519","2014","","","304","315","SimRank is an arresting measure of node-pair similarity based on hyperlinks. It iteratively follows the concept that 2 nodes are similar if they are referenced by similar nodes. Real graphs are often large, and links constantly evolve with small changes over time. This paper considers fast incremental computations of SimRank on link-evolving graphs. The prior approach [12] to this issue factorizes the graph via a singular value decomposition (SVD) first, and then incrementally maintains this factorization for link updates at the expense of exactness. Consequently, all node-pair similarities are estimated in O(r<sup>4</sup>n<sup>2</sup>) time on a graph of n nodes, where r is the target rank of the low-rank approximation, which is not negligibly small in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel fast incremental paradigm. (1) We characterize the SimRank update matrix ΔS, in response to every link update, via a rank-one Sylvester matrix equation. By virtue of this, we devise a fast incremental algorithm computing similarities of n<sup>2</sup> node-pairs in O(Kn<sup>2</sup>) time for K iterations. (2) We also propose an effective pruning technique capturing the “affected areas” of ΔS to skip unnecessary computations, without loss of exactness. This can further accelerate the incremental SimRank computation to O(K(nd+|AFF|)) time, where d is the average in-degree of the old graph, and |AFF| (≤ n<sup>2</sup>) is the size of “affected areas” in ΔS, and in practice, |AFF| ≪ n<sup>2</sup>. Our empirical evaluations verify that our algorithm (a) outperforms the best known link-update algorithm [12], and (b) runs much faster than its batch counterpart when link updates are small.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4799-2555-1; POD:978-1-4799-2556-8; USB:978-1-4799-2554-4","10.1109/ICDE.2014.6816660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816660","","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Equations;Heuristic algorithms;Matrix converters;Matrix decomposition;Vectors","approximation theory;computational complexity;graph theory;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);singular value decomposition","O(Kn<sup>2</sup>) time;O(r<sup>4</sup>n<sup>2</sup>) time estimation;SVD;SimRank update matrix;fast incremental SimRank;fast incremental algorithm;fast incremental paradigm;graph factorization;hyperlinks;link updates;link-evolving graphs;link-update algorithm;low-rank approximation;node-pair similarities;node-pair similarity measure;pruning technique;rank-one Sylvester matrix equation;singular value decomposition","","2","","21","","","March 31 2014-April 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These main challenges are maintaining data confidentiality, enforcing fine-grained data access control, applying efficient user revocation mechanism, preventing the collusion between users to access unauthorized digital objects, achieving scalability and possessing generic construction desirable feature. In addition, the proposed system avails digital passport which is presented by the user to be granted access to any digital object in the cloud environment. The usage of digital passport minimizes the number of transactions needed to authenticate the specified user. Moreover, the digital passport simplifies the data management for users since the user has to keep his passport only to use it to access the cloud. Furthermore, the digital passport prevents a rejoined user who possesses different attributes to access his previously authorized data. Additionally, the digital passport prohibits the collusion between an authorized user and a revoked one to own the access privileges once assigned to the revoked user. The proposed system exploits public key infrastructure (PKI) to capitalize the usage of offline operations to enhance system performance and to secure the transmission of private data as well as defending man in the middle attack. It should be noted that the implementation of the proposed system has showed the system computational validity.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2830-9; POD:978-1-4799-2831-6","10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820968","Attribute Based Encryption;Cloud Computing;Proxy Re-encryption;Public Key Infrastructure","Access control;Cloud computing;Encryption;Public key;Scalability;System performance","authorisation;cloud computing;digital signatures;information retrieval;public key cryptography","PKI;cloud environments;data confidentiality;digital object sharing;digital passport;fine-grained data access control;fine-grained data access system;generic data access system;public key infrastructure;scalable data access system;storage-as-a-service","","0","","36","","","16-19 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite popular interest, an efficient implementation of tagging services is a challenge since highly dynamic schemas and sparse, heterogeneous attributes must be supported within a shared, openly writable database. NoSQL databases support dynamic schemas and sparse data but lack efficient native support for joins that are inherent to query and search functionality in tagging services. Relational databases provide sufficient support for joins, but offer a multitude of options to manifest dynamic schemas and tune sparse data models, making evaluation of a tagging service time consuming and painful. In this case-study paper, we describe a benchmark for tagging services, and propose benchmarking modules that can be used to evaluate the suitability of a database for workloads generated from tagging services. We have incorporated our modules as part of OLTP-Bench, a cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure, to understand performance characteristics of tagging systems on several relational DBMSs and cloud-based database-as-a-service (DBaaS) offerings.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3481-2; POD:978-1-4799-3482-9","10.1109/ICDEW.2014.6818331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6818331","","Benchmark testing;Data models;Indexes;Mathematical model;Relational databases;Tagging","SQL;cloud computing;information retrieval;relational databases","NoSQL databases;OLTP-Bench;benchmarking cloud-based tagging services;cloud-based database-as-a-service;data resources;heterogeneous attributes;relational DBMS;relational databases","","4","","19","","","March 31 2014-April 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many such facts are newsworthy-e.g., an athlete's outstanding performance in a game, or a viral video's impressive popularity. Effective and efficient identification of these facts assists journalists in reporting, one of the main goals of computational journalism. Technically, we consider an ever-growing table of objects with dimension and measure attributes. A situational fact is a “contextual” skyline tuple that stands out against historical tuples in a context, specified by a conjunctive constraint involving dimension attributes, when a set of measure attributes are compared. New tuples are constantly added to the table, reflecting events happening in the real world. Our goal is to discover constraint-measure pairs that qualify a new tuple as a contextual skyline tuple, and discover them quickly before the event becomes yesterday's news. A brute-force approach requires exhaustive comparison with every tuple, under every constraint, and in every measure subspace. We design algorithms in response to these challenges using three corresponding ideas-tuple reduction, constraint pruning, and sharing computation across measure subspaces. We also adopt a simple prominence measure to rank the discovered facts when they are numerous. Experiments over two real datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4799-2555-1; POD:978-1-4799-2556-8; USB:978-1-4799-2554-4","10.1109/ICDE.2014.6816644","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816644","","Algorithm design and analysis;Context;Databases;Extraterrestrial measurements;Games;Lattices;Media","data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","brute-force approach;computational journalism;conjunctive constraint;constraint pruning;constraint-measure pairs;contextual skyline tuple;dimension attributes;fact identification;historical tuple;incremental discovery;measure attributes;prominent situational facts;sharing computation;tuple reduction","","1","","14","","","March 31 2014-April 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE 802.11 has been widely deployed to provide broadband wireless network access due to its low cost, simplicity and high bandwidth capacity. However, its poor network availability and frequent network disconnection in a mobile scenario challenge real-time services. This paper presents a caching and pre-fetching mechanism based on the usage of Content Centric Network (CCN) in mobile environments. The idea is to anticipate disconnections and prefetch the content that a user is expected to access in the near future. Hence, when to trigger the caching and pre-fetching module is an essential part of the objective. This paper focuses on the design and implementation of a disconnection predictor algorithm. The method is to predict the time before a terminal disconnects from an Access Point (AP) by monitoring Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).

This paper presents a novel system architecture, called Higgins, which shows how to effectively integrate an IE engine and a HC engine. Higgins generates game questions where players choose or fill in missing relations for subject-relation-object triples. For generating multiple-choice answer candidates, we have constructed a large dictionary of entity names and relational phrases, and have developed specifically designed statistical language models for phrase relatedness. To this end, we combine semantic resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, and others with statistics derived from a large Web corpus.

The focus of this paper is data confidentiality and efficient data retrieval issues in cloud computing. The data classification and cloud model are proposed to overcome data confidentiality and efficient data retrieval issues. In this paper we propose a new cloud model, i.e., the Hybrid Multi-Cloud Data Security (HMCDS) model with data classification.

The data owners have no choice but to trust the remote third party software before they ship their data to the remote environment. In this paper we propose a new set of guiding principles for protecting outsourced data with data owner specified policy. Compared with traditional access control mechanism equipped by service providers, which can be regarded as the first layer of confinement, we aim to provide data owner a second layer of confinement on data propagation and access without modifying existing data-access applications. This is achieved by two critical techniques: (1) a policy-carrying data model that binds customer data with logical data access policy, and (2) a remote application running environment which acts as data access verifier and propagation controller. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we build the logical data propagation and access control (LDPAC) system, in which a human-readable policy abstract is provided to formulate data propagation and access. When policy-carrying data is shipped to remote service provider, the per-node LDPAC verifier module conducts the logical proof checking to mediate sensitive data access. Meanwhile, the authorized application which intends to access sensitive data is forced to run in an application container, in order to prevent sensitive data leakage through in-memory data breaches. Our evaluation shows that LDPAC system adds reasonable performance overhead for the remote sensitive data access and propagation mediation, while preserving the original service deployment.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5088-6; POD:978-1-4799-0973-5","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832010","access and propagation control;data outsourcing;data privacy;policy-carrying data model","Access control;Containers;Data models;History;Servers;Software","data protection;information retrieval;outsourcing;theorem proving;trusted computing","LDPAC system;access control mechanism;data owner specified policy;human-readable policy abstract;in-memory data breaches;lifelong policy carrying;logical data propagation and access control system;logical proof checking;outsourced data privacy protection;per-node LDPAC verifier module;policy-carrying data;policy-carrying data model;remote data access control capability;remote sensitive data access and propagation mediation;remote service provider;remote third party platform;remote third party software","","2","","29","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evaluation results show that 1) touch gestures can serve robust signatures of gameplay as the key traits of the touch gestures from different subjects remain consistent; 2) our scheme can give reasonably accurate recommendations of similar games simply based on touch gestures.","2156-8138;21568138","Electronic:978-1-4799-2961-0; POD:978-1-4799-2962-7","10.1109/NetGames.2013.6820609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820609","","Feature extraction;Games;Land mobile radio;Presses;Rhythm;Robustness;Tiles","computer games;gesture recognition;haptic interfaces;information retrieval;mobile computing;recommender systems","game searching;gameplay signature;mobile app marketplace;mobile game discovery;mobile game recommendation;new game discovery;player touch gestures;rank list;social recommendation;touch gesture traces","","0","","13","","","9-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some of these tweets convey information that are of mass appeal and evoke more discussion. These tweets have a stronger social impact and may be considered to be more important than others from the authors' perspective. Authors will be greatly benefitted if an automated mechanism is developed to categorize their posted tweets and extract the most important ones. In this paper, we identify the parameters that reflect the impact of a tweet for example, the length of time during which it sustained listeners' interest (time impact). We employ topic detection techniques to determine the semantic interrelationships between tweets and retrieve the underlying theme in the thread of discussion.

Traditional graph data computing models are used to dig out useful hidden information inside the data. However, the ever growing data volume is adding more and more pressures. To retrieve and discover the information, the system has to introduce a larger number of data iterations. This makes the data analysis operations becoming slower. To speed up these operations on large-scale graph data, recent research works focus on developing efficient parallel iteration processing strategies. However, the synchronization requirements between successive iterations can severely jeopardize the effectiveness of parallel operations. In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale graph data processing model, Arbor, to address these issues. Arbor substitutes time-constrained synchronization operations with nontime-constrained control message transmissions to increase the degree of parallelism. Furthermore, it develops a new graph data organization format, which can not only save storage space, but also accelerate graph data processing operations. We compare Arbor with other graph processing models using a large-scale experimental graph data, and the results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art systems.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5088-6; POD:978-1-4799-0973-5","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6831933","graph aggregation;graph analysis;graph data;graph data processing;graph query","Computational modeling;Data analysis;Data models;Organizations;Synchronization;Time factors","data encapsulation;graph theory;information retrieval;iterative methods;parallel processing;social networking (online);synchronisation","Arbor;SNS;data analysis;data hiding;data organization mechanism;efficient large-scale graph data computing model;information discovery;information retrieval;large-scale graph data processing model;large-scale social network service;nontime-constrained control message transmissions;parallel iteration processing strategy;storage space;successive iterations;synchronization requirements;time-constrained synchronization operations","","1","","25","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linguistic context significantly boost KWS performance with respect to methods which ignore word contexts and/or rely on image-matching with pre-segmented isolated words. On the other hand, WG-based KWS can be significantly faster than other KWS approaches which directly work on the original images where, in general, computational demands are exceedingly high. A large WG contains most of the relevant information of the original text (line) image needed for KWS but, if it is too large, the computational advantages over traditional, image matching-based KWS become diminished. Conversely, if it is too small, relevant information may be lost, leading to degraded KWS precision/recall performance. We study the trade off between WG size and KWS information retrieval performance.

Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia","2013 International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics and Its Applications (IC3INA)","20140522","2013","","","337","342","Decision mining is combination of process mining and machine learning technique to retrieve information about how an attribute in a business process affects a case's route choice. It identifies decision point by looking for XOR-splits in petri-net workflow model and analyzing rules for each choice based on available attributes using decision tree. Problem emerges when decision mining technique is used on a workflow that does not use either XOR or AND splits, for example OR-split gateway logic. OR-split does not have explicit representation in petri nets and it makes decision mining algorithm cannot find its decision point. Workflow pattern that uses OR-split as its splitting logic is multi choice. Multi choice does not have its own explicit representation in form of petri net and it is problematic to apply decision mining to this workflow pattern. To make multi choice can be analyzed by decision miner some modification needs to be applied to the petri net representation of this pattern. This paper proposes modification of OR-split gateway representation in petri net. The new representation of OR-split uses combination the existing XOR-split and AND-split to make the model easier to be analyzed using decision miner. The proposed modification do not affect the conformance of event log and process model, but will allow each choice branch to be checked by decision miner.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-1076-2; Electronic:978-1-4799-1078-6; POD:978-1-4799-1077-9","10.1109/IC3INA.2013.6819197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819197","decision mining;decision tree;multi choice;process mining;workflow pattern","Analytical models;Companies;Decision trees;Logic gates;PROM;Routing","Petri nets;business data processing;data mining;decision trees;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","OR-split gateway representation;Petri net representation;Petri-net workflow model;XOR-splits;business process;decision mining;decision tree;information retrieval;machine learning technique;multi choice workflow patterns;process mining","","4","","16","","","19-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the proposed architecture, homeowners can monitor their basic energy usage information, and can perform necessary appliance management based on their pre-defined load priority, preferences, and comfort settings. The proposed architecture is designed based on the Standard Energy Usage Information (PAP10), which ensures interoperability among smart grid equipment. It is also designed with comprehensive security measures. It is expected that the proposed architecture can serve as a reference model for custom hardware designs and implementation of a real time, lightweight and reliable embedded web server for HEM applications in the smart grid environment.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3653-3; POD:978-1-4799-3654-0; USB:978-1-4799-3652-6","10.1109/ISGT.2014.6816418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816418","Smart grid;ZigBee communications and Home Energy Management;smart appliance interface","Energy management;Home appliances;Logic gates;Protocols;Standards;Web services;Zigbee","Web services;domestic appliances;energy management systems;information retrieval;smart power grids","Web services interface;appliance management;home energy management system;information retrieval;smart grid equipment;standard energy usage information","","3","","16","","","19-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In past few years, several ICN architectures have been proposed offering different set of features and characteristics, which makes it difficult to choose a particular architecture, given some network conditions and characteristics at hand. These characteristics include IP compatibility, and choice of naming structures etc. Besides, there is a little focus on a number of challenging areas including congestion control, availability, sporadic behavior, multi-source multi-destination and security etc. Moreover, it is not clear how ICN approaches behave with different emerging network environments such as user-centric networking, object-centric networking, Software-Defined networking and Cloud Computing. In this paper, we target all these issues together. First, we attempt to categorize different ICN architectures based on some common characteristics. Second, we identify a number of research challenges in the ICN domain and provide suggestions on mapping them to different ICN approaches. At the end, we bisect ICN approaches based on their characteristics and classify them on the basis of usability which helps a user choose a particular ICN approach given network requirements at hand.","2379-1268;23791268","Electronic:978-1-4799-5249-6; POD:978-1-4799-5250-2","10.1109/WOCC.2014.6839927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6839927","Categorization of ICN;Classification;Cloud Computing;Content-Centric Networking;Information-Centric Networking","Availability;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;IP networks;Routing;Security","IP networks;cloud computing;computer network security;information retrieval;telecommunication congestion control","ICN architectures;IP compatibility;bandwidth utilization;cloud computing;congestion control;content dissemination;content retrieval;information-centric networks;mobility support;multisource multidestination;object-centric networking;software-defined networking;sporadic behavior;user-centric networking","","0","","39","","","9-10 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But due to increase in complexity of services there is requirement for dynamic interaction models. In two sided service-oriented systems, both human provided services and software services are combined together to provide a single service. For a two sided service system to work properly we need a context-sensitive trust based on our modified trust algorithm which process exact skill matching and retrieval of Information based on proper content rank. Our contribution to this system is this new modified trust algorithm which process to evaluate trust based on the expert rank and their content quality of their resources provided. We also make the system available for public use and available for two sided markets, hence effectively reduces complexity in combining HPS and software services and provides superior exploration designed for knowledgeable users.","","Electronic:978-1-84919-846-2","10.1049/cp.2013.2314","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832329","Human provided services;Metric calculation;dynamic trust calculation;expert ranking;trust emergence","","Web services;computational complexity;content management;expert systems;groupware;information retrieval;pattern matching;service-oriented architecture;trusted computing","HPS;SOA;Web service collaboration;business environments;content quality;content rank;context sensitive trust;customized trust based search;dynamic interaction model;expert rank;expert system;exploration design;human provided services;information retrieval;knowledge users two sided service system;modified trust algorithm;service-oriented systems;services complexity;skill matching;software service;two sided markets","","0","","","","","26-27 Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"
"Research on Novel Methodology for Documentation Taxonomy for English IDIOLECT to GAIN Lesser Ambiguity Results","S. A. Lohi; A. Motwani","","2014 Fourth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies","20140529","2014","","","369","372","Information in the form of textual documents would have a huge growth due to the factors like digitization of libraries, exponential rise in internet usage, use of e-mail for various reasons, acceptability of soft copies for many works even critical financial work and other things. In view of these reasons, this paper discusses a new approach for Documentation Taxonomy (DT) based on combining efficient algorithms to be used for english language. The important aspect of automatically classifying and providing taxonomy to a set of documents into any taxonomical structure with the help of predefined categories is termed as Documentation Taxonomy. Automated Documentation Taxonomy is gaining prominence since it frees organizations from the frantic and time consuming need of manually organizing documents. This manual process can be expensive and given the time constraints of the application or the number of documents involved, simply not feasible. In terms of accuracy, modern documentation taxonomy systems proves better than that of trained human professionals, which is made possible by a combination of information retrieval technology and machine learning technology. This research put forwards a mechanism that shows that the use of combination of different algorithms brings down the ambiguity in taxonomical issues. There are numerable useful applications of this approach spanning various scientific and general fields of work.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3070-8; POD:978-1-4799-3071-5","10.1109/CSNT.2014.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821420","Deductive Inference;Documentation Taxonomy;Lazy Evaluation Method (Fast-KNN);Space Reduction;pair-relation","Communication systems","inference mechanisms;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis","English idiolect;English language;Internet usage;deductive inference;document classification;document organization;documentation taxonomy;e-mail;information retrieval technology;library digitization;machine learning technology;taxonomical structure;textual documents","","0","","12","","","7-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
