This paper proposes a novel methodology combining self organizing maps and case based reasoning implemented using a relational database management system to access, examine, diagnose and propose recommendations for improving trunk postural control. A self organizing map was developed to classify the input dataset gathered during a tandem Romberg stability test which behaved as the knowledgebase of the system. Case based reasoning was incorporated based on its ability to solve new problems by adopting previously defined, successful solutions to analogous problems. The case based reasoning architecture was implemented using a relational database with the self organizing map integrated to retrieve analogous case records to solve a new case. The prediction accuracy of the hybrid system to accurately produce the most similar case for a given new case was tested using leave-one-out-cross-validation method. The results demonstrated a high prediction accuracy of over 90% confirming the effectiveness of the hybrid methodology for evaluating and predicting recommendations for performance improvement based on existing knowledgebase for postural control.","","DVD:978-1-4244-5425-9; Electronic:978-1-4244-5426-6; POD:978-1-4244-5424-2","10.1109/MFI.2010.5604475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5604475","Case Based Reasoning;Hybrid Systems;Postural Control;Relational Database;Self Organizing Maps","Accuracy;Cognition;Graphical user interfaces;Kinematics;Neurons;Stability analysis;Training","biocontrol;biology computing;case-based reasoning;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;relational databases;self-organising feature maps;stability","analogous case record retrieval;case based reasoning;hybrid intelligent system;knowledgebase system;leave one out cross validation method;postural control;rehabilitation strategy;relational database management system;self organizing map;stability assessment;tandem Romberg stability test","","2","","26","","","5-7 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current approaches are mostly surface-oriented (or use only shallow syntactic representations) and see each text only as a token list. In this work however, we describe a deep, semantically oriented method based on semantic networks which are derived by a syntactico-semantic parser. Semantically identical or similar semantic networks for each sentence of a given base text are efficiently retrieved by using a specialized semantic network index. In order to detect many kinds of paraphrases the current base semantic network is varied by applying inferences: lexico-semantic relations, relation axioms, and meaning postulates. Some important phenomena occurring in difficult-to-detect duplicates are discussed. The deep approach profits from background knowledge, whose acquisition from corpora like Wikipedia is explained briefly. This deep duplicate recognizer is combined with two shallow duplicate recognizers in order to guarantee high recall for texts which are not fully parsable. The evaluation shows that the combined approach preserves recall and increases precision considerably, in comparison to traditional shallow methods. For the evaluation, a standard corpus of German plagiarisms was extended by four diverse components with an emphasis on duplicates (and not just plagiarisms), e.g., news feed articles from different web sources and two translations of the same short story.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6899-7; POD:978-1-4244-6896-6","10.1109/NLPKE.2010.5587838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587838","Duplicate detection;Entailments;Paraphrases;Plagiarism;Semantic networks;Support vector machine","Density estimation robust algorithm;Detectors;Pragmatics;Tin","grammars;information retrieval;text analysis","German plagiarisms;deep duplicate recognizer;duplicate text detection;parser-based methods;syntactico-semantic parser","","0","","15","","","21-23 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although several methods have shown the ability to assign structures to the tags, their limitation still remains. Accordingly, this study investigates a method to build the place hierarchy of geo-referenced tags. In particular, the method is based on analyzing geometric patterns of footprints, derived from the tags. The objectives are to understand the structure of vernacular geography and to improve the image search by constructing tag semantics. First, the geographical regions are represented based on the large sets of the clustered collaborative tags on the place. Herein, the method to generate the chi-shape derives the footprints of the geographical regions. According to its geometric condition such as position, area, and centroid of the polygon, derived from each footprint, the place-tag hierarchies are constructed. The geographical boundaries between the place tags are established throughout the assigned footprints as well. In addition, our method enhances the accuracy of the tag hierarchies when compared to the previous research. Furthermore, the study also contributes to the development of the tag semantics and the comprehension of the vernacular geography.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4211-9; POD:978-1-4244-8439-3","10.1109/SocialCom.2010.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5591334","Flickr;cluster;geo-referenced tag;geo-tag;geometric pattern;place hierarchy","Accuracy;Clocks;Clustering algorithms;Data visualization;Geography;Tag clouds","geographic information systems;geometry;information retrieval;knowledge acquisition","geo-referenced tags;geometric pattern-based method;geometric patterns;knowledge extraction;knowledge structure;tag semantics;tagging system;vernacular geography","","0","","18","","","20-22 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"On monitoring information flow of outsourced data","A. V. D. M. Kayem","Department of Computer Science, University of Cape Town, Private Bag X3, Rondebosch, 7701 South Africa","2010 Information Security for South Africa","20100930","2010","","","1","8","Data outsourcing is an Internet-based paradigm that allows organizations to share data cost-effectively by transferring data to a third-party service provider for management. Enforcing outsourced data privacy in untrustworthy environments is challenging because the data needs to be kept secret both from unauthorized users and the service provider (SP). Existing approaches propose that the data owner(s) encrypt the data before it is transferred to the service provider to preserve confidentiality. Access is only granted to a user initiated program if the key presented can decrypt the data into a readable format. Therefore the data owner can control access to the data without having to worry about the management costs. However, this approach fails to monitor the data once it has been retrieved from the SP's end. So, a user can retrieve information from the SP's end and share it with unauthorized users or even the SP. We propose a conceptual framework, based on the concept of dependence graphs, for monitoring data exchanges between programs in order to prevent unauthorized access. The framework has a distributed architecture which is suitable for data outsourcing environments and the web in general. Each data object contains a cryptographic tag (like an invisible digital watermark) that is computed by using a cryptographic hash function to combine the checksum of the data and the encryption key. In order to execute an operation with a data object the key presented for decryption must match the one associated with the user's role and generate a cryptographic tag that matches the one embedded into the data. Tracing data exchanges, in this way, can leverage data privacy for organizations that transfer data management to third party service providers.","2330-9881;23309881","Electronic:978-1-4244-5495-2; POD:978-1-4244-5493-8","10.1109/ISSA.2010.5588602","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5588602","","Access control;Cryptography;Data privacy;Monitoring;Organizations;Service oriented architecture","Internet;cryptography;data privacy;electronic data interchange;information retrieval;outsourcing","Internet based paradigm;cryptographic hash function;cryptographic tag;data decryption;data encryption;data exchange;data management;data monitoring;data outsourcing;data privacy;dependence graph;distributed architecture;information retrieve;management cost;monitoring information flow;outsourced data privacy;service provider;unauthorized user;untrustworthy environment","","4","","18","","","2-4 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is evident in, for example, the increasing number of tagging systems offering tag clouds for navigational purposes, which hints towards an implicit assumption that tag clouds support efficient navigation. In this paper, we examine and test this assumption from a network-theoretic perspective, and show that in many cases it does not hold. We first model navigation in tagging systems as a bipartite graph of tags and resources and then simulate the navigation process in such a graph. We use network-theoretic properties to analyse the navigability of three tagging datasets with regard to different user interface restrictions imposed by tag clouds. Our results confirm that tag resource networks have efficient navigation properties in theory, but they also show that popular user interface decisions (such as “pagination” combined with reverse-chronological listing of resources) significantly impair the potential of tag clouds as a useful tool for navigation. Based on our findings, we identify a number of avenues for further research and the design of novel tag cloud construction algorithms. Our work is relevant for researchers interested in navigability of emergent hypertext structures, and for engineers seeking to improve the navigability of social tagging systems.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4211-9; POD:978-1-4244-8439-3","10.1109/SocialCom.2010.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5590464","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bipartite graph;Limiting;Navigation;Tag clouds;User interfaces","graph theory;information retrieval;social networking (online);user interfaces","bipartite graph;network-theoretic perspective;social tagging systems;tag cloud construction algorithms;user interface restrictions","","5","","39","","","20-22 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous work had some limitations, such as high setup cost, inability of extracting all attributes, limitation on the types of sentences that can be handled, and insufficient consideration of interdependency among attributes. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach that uses conditional random fields and self-supervised learning. This approach treats the activity extraction as a sequence labeling problem, and has advantages such as domain-independence, scalability, and does not require any hand-tagged data. Since it is unnecessary to fix the positions and the number of the attributes in activity sentences, this approach can extract all attributes by making only a single pass over its corpus. Additionally, by converting to simpler sentences, the proposed approach can deal with complex sentences retrieved from Japanese weblogs. In an experiment, this approach achieves high precision (activity: 88.87%, attributes: over 90%).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4147-1; POD:978-1-4244-8198-9","10.1109/ICIS.2010.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5590986","Conditional Random Fields;Human Activity;Self-Supervised Learning;Semantic Network;Web Mining","Data mining;Feature extraction;Logic gates;Markov processes;Syntactics;Testing;Training data","Web sites;data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);semantic networks;text analysis","Japanese Weblogs;activity extraction;automatic mining;human activity attribute;self-supervised learning;semantic network;sentence retrieval;sequence labeling problem","","0","","26","","","18-20 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The idea is not to create the fastest controller but a human-like controller. In order to achieve this, first we have created a process to build a model of the tracks while the car is running and then we used several neural networks which predict the trajectory the car should follow and the target speed. A scripted policy is used for the gear change and to follow the predicted trajectory with the predicted speed. The neural networks are trained with data retrieved from a human player, and are evaluated in a new track. The results shows an acceptable performance of the controller in unknown tracks, more than 20% slower than the human in the same tracks because of the mistakes made when the controller tries to follow the trajectory.","2325-4270;23254270","Electronic:978-1-4244-6297-1; POD:978-1-4244-6295-7; USB:978-1-4244-6296-4","10.1109/ITW.2010.5593318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593318","","Artificial neural networks;Games;Gears;Humans;Sensors;Trajectory;Wheels","automobiles;computer games;human factors;information retrieval;neural nets","data retrieval;human like TORCS controller;human player;neural network;scripted policy;simulated car racing championship;speed prediction;the open racing car simulator;trajectory prediction","","5","","17","","","18-21 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main idea of reducing the crawling cost is to retrieving those lately modified pages and newly added pages only. However, in reality, it is impossible for traditional crawler to judge whether a page has been modified or newly added without doing a whole crawling. We propose a method to predict those lately modified pages and newly added pages without do any actual crawling; we also find a feasible and stable feature ""structure pattern"" to better indicates the modified probability of certain page. In the meanwhile, we develop a hybrid clustering method combined with K-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering to automatically find all the structure patterns in certain website. Using structure pattern, we developed an unsupervised algorithm to generate website's templates; using templates, crawler can extract useful information of web pages much more easily and precisely. We also introduce feasible formulas to predict pages' modified probabilities and crawling time intervals. To evaluate the performance of an incremental crawling algorithm, we proposed three new indicators. Using the algorithm proposed, we could extract content of pages with high performance. The experimental results illustrate that structure pattern is very useful and the performance of this cognitive crawler is quite promising and it can save huge amount of bandwidth and is qualified for different websites of various scales.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8042-5; POD:978-1-4244-8041-8","10.1109/COGINF.2010.5599733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599733","Incremental crawler;content extraction;hybrid clustering;structure pattern;template generation","Cognitive informatics;Sun","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","Web pages;Website crawling;Website templates;agglomerative hierarchical clustering;cognitive crawler;content extraction;hybrid clustering method;incremental crawling algorithm;k-means clustering;structure pattern;unsupervised algorithm","","0","","9","","","7-9 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, to incentivize contributions, file-sharing systems based on the BitTorrent protocol equate value with volume of contributed content and use a prioritization mechanism to reward users who contribute more. This approach and similar techniques used in resource-sharing systems rely on the fact that the physical resources shared among users are easily quantifiable. In contrast, information-sharing systems, like social tagging systems, lack the notion of a physical resource unit (e.g., content size, bandwidth) that facilitates the task of evaluating user contributions. For this reason, the issue of estimating the value of user contributions in information sharing systems remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces this problem and takes the first steps towards a solution. More precisely, it presents a framework to design algorithms that estimate the value of user contributions in tagging systems, proposes three complementary success criteria for potential solutions, and outlines the methodological evaluation challenges.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4211-9; POD:978-1-4244-8439-3","10.1109/SocialCom.2010.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5591289","entropy;information value;tagging systems;web","Calculators;Context;Entropy;Navigation;Production systems;Tagging","Internet;file organisation;information retrieval;peer-to-peer computing;social networking (online)","BitTorrent protocol;Web;file-sharing systems;incentivize contributions;information-sharing systems;peer-production systems;prioritization mechanism;social tagging systems","","0","","38","","","20-22 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model then incorporates the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for detection of sentences containing patterns of terrorism evidence. For incorporation of CRF model, the features are selected from generalized patterns rather than the text itself. We prepared a small data set of manually tagged instances of terrorism evidence for training and testing the model. We found that the proposed model achieves better results than other models such as Hidden Markov Model or conventional CRF which are directly applied to text. The proposed model can be applied for improvement of terrorism event extraction and ontology creation systems, especially with the focus towards their effective role in Open Source Intelligence.

One of the most important criteria for a word to be selected as keyword is its relevance for the text. The tf.idf score of a term is a widely used relevance measure. While easy to compute and giving quite satisfactory results, this measure does not take (semantic) relations between words into account. In this paper we study some alternative relevance measures that do use relations between words. They are computed by defining co-occurrence distributions for words and comparing these distributions with the document and the corpus distribution. We then evaluate keyword extraction algorithms defined by selecting different relevance measures. For two corpora of abstracts with manually assigned keywords, we compare manually extracted keywords with different automatically extracted ones.

However, index generation from an automatic transcription has many problems because the automatic transcription has many recognition errors and Out-Of-Vocabulary words. To solve this problem, we propose a document expansion method using Web documents. To obtain important keywords which included in the spoken document but lost by recognition errors, we acquire Web documents relevant to the spoken document. Then, an index of the spoken document is generated by combining an index that generated from the automatic transcription and the Web documents. We propose a method for retrieval of relevant documents, and the experimental result shows that the retrieved Web document contained many OOV words. Next, we propose a method for combining the recognized index and the Web index. The experimental result shows that the index of the spoken document generated by the document expansion was closer to an index from the manual transcription than the index generated by the conventional method. Finally, we conducted a spoken document retrieval experiment, and the document-expansion-based index gave better retrieval precision than the conventional indexing method.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6899-7; POD:978-1-4244-6896-6","10.1109/NLPKE.2010.5587854","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587854","","","Internet;document handling;indexing;information retrieval;speech recognition","Web document;Web index;automatic indexing;automatic transcription;document expansion;document-expansion-based index;index generation;keywords;out-of-vocabulary words;speech recognizer;spoken document retrieval precision","","1","","17","","","21-23 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So far Natural Language Processing (NLP) research patronized much of topic based summarizer system, unable to capture thematic semantic affinity of any text i.e. a news article containing the concepts, ""gun,"" ""convenience store,"" ""demand money"" and ""make getaway"" might suggest the topics ""robbery"" and ""crime"". In this paper the development of an opinion summarization system that works on Bengali News corpus has been described. The system identifies the sentiment information in each document, aggregates them and represents the summary information in text. The present system follows a topic-sentiment model for sentiment identification and aggregation. Topic-sentiment model is designed as discourse level theme identification and the topic-sentiment aggregation is achieved by theme clustering (k-means) and Document level Theme Relational Graph representation. The Document Level Theme Relational Graph is finally used for candidate summary sentence selection by standard page rank algorithms used in Information Retrieval (IR). As Bengali is a resource constraint language, the building of annotated gold standard corpus and acquisition of linguistics tools for lexico-syntactic, syntactic and discourse level features extraction are described in this paper. The reported accuracy of the Theme detection technique is 83.60% (precision), 76.44% (recall) and 79.85% (F-measure). The summarization system has been evaluated with Precision of 72.15%, Recall of 67.32% and F-measure of 69.65%.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4211-9; POD:978-1-4244-8439-3","10.1109/SocialCom.2010.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5591520","","Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Frequency measurement;Gold;Machine learning;Organizations;Syntactics","information retrieval;natural language processing;semantic networks;text analysis","Bengali news corpus;NLP;discourse level feature extraction;discourse level theme identification;document level theme relational graph representation;information retrieval;lexico-syntactic level feature extraction;natural language processing;opinion summarization system;page rank algorithms;resource constraint language;semantic network;syntactic level feature extraction;thematic semantic affinity;theme clustering;theme detection technique;theme network model;topic based summarizer system;topic sentiment identification;topic-sentiment aggregation","","1","1","18","","","20-22 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wakabayashi","Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia","OCEANS 2010 IEEE - Sydney","20101014","2010","","","1","6","The Madura Strait area is one of the busiest marine traffic regions in Indonesia. Many ships arrive, depart and travel through that area, thus influencing the air quality of the port environment. Furthermore, the Indonesian government has not yet ratified Marine Pollution (MARPOL) 73/78 Annex VI regarding the prevention of air pollution from ships and the absence of restricting regulations could have an influence on the level of air pollution. In this study, an Automatic Identification System (AIS) receiver is used to obtain ship data. AIS recognizes a vessel's Maritime Mobil Maritime Identify (MMSI), speed of ship, initial position of ship and ship type. This data is used to evaluate the marine traffic density in the Madura Strait area. Information from ship databases and AIS data are combined for retrieving gross tonnage (GT) information, which is then used to estimate the ship's air pollution emissions. Air pollution estimates also consider the ship's operation modes such as berthing, maneuvering and hotelling. The basic aims of this study are to evaluate marine traffic contributions to the nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), sulfur oxides (SO<sub>x</sub>), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels in the Madura Strait area, and to evaluate the possibility of using AIS data when estimating air pollution levels. The emission quantities of NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>x</sub>, PM, CO (as indicators of air pollution) and CO<sub>2</sub> (as a greenhouse gas) are shown in this paper. The process for estimating emissions using AIS is a potential decision-making tool when considering issues such as the effects of ship emissions on health is also evaluated.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5222-4; POD:978-1-4244-5221-7","10.1109/OCEANSSYD.2010.5603866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5603866","","Air pollution;Engines;Estimation;Fuels;Geographic Information Systems;Marine vehicles;Receivers","air pollution;data handling;information retrieval;marine engineering;ships","Indonesia;Madura Strait;air pollution emission;air quality;automatic identification system data;carbon dioxide;carbon monoxide;exhaust emission estimation;gross tonnage information;marine pollution 73/78;marine traffic density;maritime mobil maritime identify;nitrogen oxides;particulate matter;ship databases;sulfur oxides","","2","","16","","","24-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If a user suddenly attempts to access data that is much more critical than was typically accessed in the past, this is a potential sign that the insider is acting maliciously. Few attempts at locating critical data exist in the computer security literature and we argue in this work that our novel design fulfills this need in a manner that is extensible and applicable to a wide range of problems.

This means that without additional post-processing of their outputs, these classifiers are not capable of answering a question as simple as “To which classes does a document belong with a minimum probability of 80%?” This paper presents a density estimation-based classification technique which outputs probabilities directly. The technique is based on estimating densities using von Mises-Fisher kernels, and combining these under Bayes' Theorem to arrive at posterior probabilities of class membership. Results of applying the technique to the Reuters-21578 dataset show that the technique is computationally feasible, that its classification performance as measured by F1 score is comparable to that of SVMs and better than that of kNN classifiers, and that the output values can be interpreted as well-calibrated probabilities.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4244-6918-5; POD:978-1-4244-6916-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2010.5596595","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5596595","","Equations;Kernel;Mathematical model;Nearest neighbor searches;Reliability;Training;Training data","Bayes methods;document handling;information retrieval;pattern classification;probability;support vector machines","Bayes theorem;F1 score;Reuters-21578 dataset;breakeven point;class membership;density estimation;document categorization;document classification;information retrieval measures;k nearest neighbors;posterior probability;support vector machines;von Mises-Fisher kernels","","1","","13","","","18-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Gazetteers as specialized geographical information systems bridge the gap between textual place names and geospatial locations. Most place names in gazetteers are thought of as administrative regions and described with official names. However, a place name could also be a thematic region, a functional region or a cognitive region. There is hence a need to enrich gazetteers with such vague place names and extend their applications. Geospatial location and boundary of vague place names can be induced based on the descriptions of its referred geographical entities and spatial relations in context. Here an approach is proposed to approximately model vague place names based on contextual spatial relations. Computational models for qualitative spatial relations are identified to model single spatial relations and a layer-overlapping method is presented to compute composed spatial relations.

However, previous studies for identifying technology vacuum on the patent map have been subjected to intuitive and manual identification of technology vacuum. In this context, this paper proposes a generative topographic mapping (GTM)-based patent map which aims to identify technology vacuum automatically. Since GTM is a probabilistic approach to map a low-dimensional latent space onto the multidimensional data space and vice versa, it contributes to the automatic identification of technology vacuum. This study consists of three stages. Firstly, text mining is executed to transform patent documents into keyword vectors as structured data. Secondly, the GTM is employed to develop the patent map with extracted keyword vectors and discover patent vacuums which are expressed as blank areas in the map. Lastly, technology vacuums are identified by inversely mapping patent vacuums in latent space into new vectors in data space. The procedure of the proposed approach is described in detail by employing a patent database.","2159-5100;21595100","Electronic:978-1-890843-21-2; POD:978-1-4244-8203-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5602088","","Patents;Principal component analysis;Probabilistic logic;Space technology;Text mining;Vacuum technology","data mining;information retrieval;probability;text analysis","GTM based patent map;automatic identification;data structure;generative topographic mapping;keyword vector extraction;patent analysis;patent database;patent document;probabilistic approach;technology vacuum;text mining","","0","","33","","","18-22 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the blueprints of a Colocation as a Service (CaaS) framework. CaaS strategic services identify coalitions of self-interested users that would benefit from colocation on shared instances. CaaS operational services provide the information necessary for, and carry out the reconfigurations mandated by strategic services. CaaS could be incorporated into an IaaS offering by providers; it could be implemented as a value-added proposition by IaaS resellers; or it could be directly leveraged in a peer-to-peer fashion by IaaS users. To establish the practicality of such offerings, this paper presents XCS - a prototype implementation of CaaS on top of the Xen hypervisor. XCS makes specific choices with respect to the various elements of the CaaS framework: it implements strategic services based on a game-theoretic formulation of colocation; it features novel concurrent migration heuristics which are shown to be efficient; and it offers monitoring and accounting services at both the hypervisor and VM layers. Extensive experimental results obtained by running PlanetLab trace-driven workloads on the XCS prototype confirm the premise of CaaS - by demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of XCS, and by quantifying the potential cost savings accrued through the use of XCS.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7627-5; POD:978-1-4244-7628-2","10.1109/NCA.2010.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598227","","Bandwidth;Engines;Games;Memory management;Monitoring;Prototypes;Resource management","Internet;game theory;information resources;information retrieval;peer-to-peer computing","CaaS;IaaS provider;PlanetLab trace driven workload;XCS;Xen hypervisor;cloud colocation;colocation as a service;game theoretic formulation;infrastructure as a service;operational service;peer-to-peer fashion;self- interested users;strategic service;value- added proposition","","7","1","36","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main contribution of this study is to explore and refine determinants of external information search behavior in the tourism context, the context which has not been fully explored in the literatures, and the features that could be used to characterize tourists' external information search behavior. This study utilized a so-called “Three-pronged approach”, an approach to cross validate among the result from literature review, expert interviews, and an exploratory field study in order to confirm and propose a reliable conceptual framework. Findings from the three-pronged approach suggested 11 components as determinants of external information search behavior and 4 features that could be used to define tourists' external information search behavior itself.

However, we treat the problem as a recommendation problem in the context of social search, that is, expert recommendations are personalized for a questioner based on his/her history. The intuition is that questioners look not only for authoritative responders, but for a combination of authority and personal trust or affinity. The significance of these factors depends on user intent in asking the question, and varies with each question, and with questioner personality. An iterative algorithm is proposed to model user intent for a question in terms of whether they are looking for authoritative experts, or individuals in their social networks, and an expert recommendation algorithm based on it is tested on data crawled from the Yahoo!

LOM is such a technique that makes the retrieval of “neighboring” data more efficient by using “stepwise selection” and quantization. This paper reports an Extended Sequential Prediction (ESP) method of LOM with the local regression model. The ESP method is able to predict process variables over a long period by modeling the operator and the plant based on LOM, the approach is to repeat a process that predicts the process variables of the next step by using the predicted variables of the previous step. The method is applied to a dynamic industrial furnace with several deeply-intertwined physical phenomena; practical effectiveness of the method is verified. As a result, the method has predicted the process variables with satisfactory accuracy.","","DVD:978-4-907764-35-7; Electronic:978-4-907764-36-4; POD:978-1-4244-7642-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5602285","ESP;JIT modeling;LOM;industrial furnace;operation support;sequential prediction","Accuracy;Data models;Databases;Furnaces;Input variables;Mathematical model;Predictive models","flow production systems;furnaces;information retrieval;just-in-time;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","LOM;data retrieval;extended sequential prediction;industrial furnace;just in time;large scale database based online model;lazy learning;regression model","","0","","7","","","18-21 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve this problem, a retrieval method was developed using semantic technologies based on RESTful web services. In order to accomplish this, first the system structure was defined and the description style was modeled based on the integrated search system for OpenAPIs; then semantic markup (tagging, semantic annotation) was added to the HTML description pages. Next, the RDF document was extracted from the HTML and stored in a service repository.

Satellite remote sensing provides an unprecedented spatial coverage of land surface and atmospheric data that are logistically and economically impossible to obtain through ground based observation networks. The surface temperature-normalized difference vegetation index (Ts-NDVI) triangle method based on remote sensing datasets was widely applied to estimate regional ET. However, little research focused on influence of topography on triangle method application in complex topographic areas. To retrieve more accurate ET, topographic correction should be employed in mountainous areas. In this study, we estimate ET by triangle method with topographic correction from MODIS datasets in Taihu Basin, China. The evaporative fraction (EF), defined as the ratio of ET and available radiant energy, was estimated by the triangle method with topographic correction. And then, spatially distributed net radiation (Rn) maps were retrieved as an estimate of available energy to get both the spatial and temporal distribution maps of ET for clear sky days.

Also, we assess the emotionality facet in news related blogs to enable users to identify people's feelings towards specific events. Our approach is to evaluate the performance of text classifiers with lexical and stylometric features to determine the best performing combination for our tasks.

The fact that the technological information in patents is almost stored in text format makes the monitoring task a hard work. The purpose of this study is to introduce a new approach which combines chance discovery, one of a text mining techniques, and survival analysis to explore the emergence of technology terms and to identify their potential. This study applies the chance discovery to extract technological terms which are important but occur infrequently. Moreover, this study conducts longitudinal analysis by employing survival analysis on the occurrence time for the extracted technological terms. The hazard rate is used as an indicator to identify the potential of the terms. This study collected solar cell patent documents from both of issued and applied databases to perform the proposed approach. The patents of 2001 to January 2005 serves as experimental sample to calculate the hazard rates of extracted technological terms and those from July 2005 to 2008 are for validity testing.

In this paper, the SO of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the polar words. Then the SO of the given blog text is determined by the max mutual information value. A blog text is classified as joy if the SO of its phrases is joy. Two different corpora are adopted to test our method, one is the Blog corpus collected by Monitor and Research Center for National Language Resource Network Multimedia Sub-branch Center, and the other is Chinese dataset provided by COAE2008 task.

Since the SERP itself and the ranking order change with time reflecting the changes in society, it might be possible to accurately follow the movement of society by mining SERPs. This paper reports the design and implementation of a SERP mining tool named SERPWatcher. It provides sophisticated interfaces and functions for SERP miners in the field of social sciences to discover social changes. It could be a novel social survey method in that it totally differs from the traditional methods such as questionnaires and interviews. A research prototype of SERPWatcher is currently under operation, and its validation test shows that it has a fail-safe nature in the sense that social changes are mirrored on the changes of the SERP ranking order.

Automated processing of numerous open source intelligence sources requires the discovery of key domain terms, their conceptual hierarchies and the coherent relationships among them. A syntactic analysis of the word sequences in unstructured text documents allows for the extraction of subject-predicate-object triples, which form the basis for Term Extraction Patterns (TEP). In our research, we use TEPs to discover domain-specific multi-word entities which in turn, can be arranged in a taxonomy based on their semiotic inter-relationships. We explore the use of this method within the cyber security domain and analyze a collection of related news articles gathered from various public web sources. In this paper our initial results of term extraction and the semantic coherence derived from the TEP analyses are described.

However, in contrast to the mostly static documents on the current Web, the state of real-world entities as captured by sensors is highly dynamic. Thus, searching for real-world entities with a certain state is a challenging problem.

You generally do not have one without the other. Taking inspiration from life experience, a new form of computer memory has been devised. Certain conjectures about human memory are keys to the central idea. The design of a practical and useful “cognitive” memory system is contemplated, a memory system that may also serve as a model for many aspects of human memory. The new memory does not function like a computer memory where specific data is stored in specific numbered registers and retrieval is done by reading the contents of the specified memory register, or done by matching key words as with a document search. Incoming sensory data would be stored at the next available empty memory location, and indeed could be stored redundantly at several empty locations. The stored sensory data would neither have key words nor would it be located in known or specified memory locations. Sensory inputs concerning a single object or subject are stored together as vectors in a single “file folder” or “memory folder.” When the contents of the folder are retrieved, sights, sounds, tactile feel, smell, etc., are obtained all at the same time. Sensor fusion is a memory phenomenon. The sensory signals are not fused, but they are simply recorded together in the same folder and retrieved together. Retrieval would be initiated by a prompt signal from a current set of sensory inputs or patterns. A search through the memory would be made to locate stored data that correlates with or relates to the present real-time sensory inputs. The search would be done by a retrieval system that makes use of autoassociative artificial neural networks. Applications of cognitive memory systems have been made to visual aircraft identification, aircraft navigation, and human facial recognition. Other applications to speech recognition and control systems are being - - explored.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8042-5; POD:978-1-4244-8041-8","10.1109/COGINF.2010.5599839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599839","","Aircraft navigation;Artificial neural networks;Computers;Electrical engineering;Humans;Medals;Registers","cognitive systems;information retrieval;sensor fusion","aircraft navigation;autoassociative artificial neural networks;cognitive memory system;computer memory;control systems;human facial recognition;human memory;memory phenomenon;memory register;retrieval system;sensor fusion;speech recognition;visual aircraft identification","","1","","","","","7-9 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially, a baseline system is developed by considering the most frequent temporal relation in the task's training data. For CRF, we consider only those features that are already available in the TempEval-2007 training set. Evaluation results on the Task C test set yield precision, recall and F-score values of 55.1%, 55.1% and 55.1%, respectively under the strict evaluation scheme and 56.9%, 56.9 and 56.9%, respectively under the relaxed evaluation scheme. Results also show that the proposed system performs better than the baseline system.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6899-7; POD:978-1-4244-6896-6","10.1109/NLPKE.2010.5587774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587774","Conditional Random Field;TempEval 2007 Task C;Temporal Relation Identification;TimeML","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Speech;Training;Training data","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","TimeML framework;conditional random field;event-event relation identification;machine learning technique;natural language processing;temporal information extraction","","2","","10","","","21-23 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The highly ordered temporal structure of music suggests it should be amendable to analysis by a novel spiking neural network paradigm: the liquid state machine (LSM). Unlike conventional statistical approaches that require the presence of static input data, the LSM has a unique ability to classify music in real-time, due to its dynamics and fading-memory. This paper investigates the performance of an LSM in classifying musical styles (ragtime vs. classical), as well as its ability to distinguish music from note sequences without temporal structure.

Ontology based warehousing and mining modeling are recommended for resolving the issues of scaling and formatting of multidimensional datasets, in which case, seismic and well-domain datasets are described. Issues, such as semantics among different data dimensions and their associated attributes are also addressed by Ontology modeling. Intelligent relationships are built among several petroleum system domains (structure, reservoir, source and seal, for example) at global scale and facilitated the integration process among multiple dimensions in a data warehouse environment.

In addition, an upper bound of one minus NDCG is given by weighted pairwise loss, and a connection between weighted pairwise loss and NDCG is also revealed. In this paper, RBF regression model and the pairwise shifted hinge loss and logistic loss are proposed under the suggested approach. One benefit of the proposed approach is that the weighted pairwise loss is more reasonable than the unweighted loss and all the weights are set based on the NDCG. Finally, one synthetic example shows that the method incorporated the ranking as hard constraints into regression model may cause the deteriorated results, but the good performance is shown by the proposed method.

In this paper, we introduce a personalized feed recommendation service for SNS users based on user interests and social network contexts. Our approach incorporates both the topical preference and topological locality of a user in determining a feed's relevance. We propose a popularity diffusion model to propagate feeds in social networks and support our recommendation service with a set of personalized indices for feed-based information retrieval. A suite of efficient index manipulation algorithms are developed in our framework to address the need of managing the dynamics in social networks.
