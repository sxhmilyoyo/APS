This paper proposes efficient methods for image classification using 3 MPEG-7 descriptors to represent color and texture features. Additionally, we apply Support Vector Machine and Fuzzy algorithm to extract linguistic fuzzy rules, in order to bridge the ""semantic gap"" between the lower-lever descriptors and the high-level semantic of an image.

We apply a vector space model to recommend experts for resolving bugs. When a new bug report arrives, the system automatically assigns it to the appropriate developer considering his or her expertise, current workload, and preferences.

One problem making interoperability difficult is the lack of automated methods simplifying the mapping process. In this study, we propose an automated approach to mapping external terminologies to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Our approach applies a sequential combination of two basic matching methods classically used in ontology matching. First, a lexical technique identifies similar strings between the external terminology and the UMLS. Second, a structure-based technique validates, in part, the lexical alignmentby computing paths to top-level concepts and checking the compatibility of these top-level concepts across the external terminology and the UMLS. The method was applied to the mapping of the large-scale biomedical thesaurus EMTREE to the complete UMLS Metathesaurus. In total, 47.9% coverage of EMTREE terms was reached, leading to 80% coverage of EMTREE concepts. Our method has revealed a high compatibility in 6 out of 15 top-level categories across terminologies. The validation of lexical mappings ranges over 75.8% of the total lexical alignment. Overall, the method rules out a total of 6927 (7.9%) lexical mappings, with a global precision of 78%.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2009.2015651","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797856","Ontology matching;Unified Medical Language System (UMLS);terminology mapping","Biological materials;Biomedical computing;Biomedical materials;Computer science;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Medical services;Ontologies;Terminology;Thesauri;Unified modeling language;Vocabulary","bioinformatics;medical computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);thesauri","EMTREE;biomedical terminology mapping;large-scale biomedical thesaurus;lexical technique;ontology matching;structure-based technique;unified medical language system","Algorithms;Biomedical Research;Databases, Bibliographic;Linguistics;Natural Language Processing;Reproducibility of Results;Terminology as Topic;Unified Medical Language System;Vocabulary, Controlled","8","","26","","20090304","June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The architectureconsists of three-planes of functionalities (in the verticaldimension): 1) data, 2) control, and 3) management; and four-tiers of network infrastructures (in the horizontal dimension): 1) routing and network infrastructure, 2) logical network infrastructure, 3) adaptation middleware, and 4) component-based software application. The data plane handles the information storage, reduction, and dissemination in WSNs. The control plane deals with the lightweight sensor adaptation and reconfiguration middleware to cope with the dynamic changes of the environment. Finally, the management plane provides the context management functions, e.g. for collaboration and reasoning, to allow sensors, coordinators, and sinks to make good decisions about adaptation and reconfiguration.

The proposed technique uses information explicitly provided by the user in his profile as well as information that the mechanism can learn from the userpsilas behavior during his search and browsing sessions in the system. As this behavior dynamically evolves, the same happens to the userpsilas interests under the prism of the search engine. By adopting this user-centric approach, we manage to present the user with better-refined and more focused results, incorporating his personal preferences to the output. The algorithm operates not in a stand-alone manner but it co-operates and binds with the rest of modules of PeRSSonal in order to accomplish maximum integration with the system.

Four annotation-based ranking methods were proposed. The result showed that using only annotation as an index of resources may not be appropriate. Since social annotations could be viewed as a high level concept of the content, combining them to the content of resource could add some more important concepts to the resources.

The agglutinative nature of Turkish leads to a high number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words which in turn lower automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. This situation compromises the performance of speech retrieval systems based on ASR output. Therefore using a word-based ASR is not adequate for transcribing speech in Turkish. To alleviate this problem, various sub-word-based recognition units are utilized. These units solve the OOV problem with moderate size vocabularies and perform even better than a 500 K word vocabulary as far as recognition accuracy is concerned. As a novel approach, the interaction between recognition units, words and sub-words, and discriminative training is explored. Sub-word models benefit from discriminative training more than word models do, especially in the discriminative language modeling framework. For speech retrieval, a spoken term detection system based on automata indexation is utilized. As with transcription, retrieval performance is measured under various schemes incorporating words and sub-words. Best results are obtained using a cascade of word and sub-word indexes together with term-specific thresholding.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2008.2012313","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071138","Discriminative training;language modeling (LM);morphologically rich languages;speech recognition;spoken term detection","Automata;Automatic speech recognition;Broadcasting;Councils;Information retrieval;Morphology;Natural languages;Speech recognition;Statistical analysis;Vocabulary","natural language processing;speech recognition","automata indexation;automatic speech recognition;discriminative language modeling framework;speech retrieval systems;transcription and retrieval system","","32","1","57","","20090610","July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We also present the ontology used to expand such queries: it allows us to semantically represent the domain knowledge on people fulfilling a role during a temporal interval in general, and politicians holding a political office specifically.

Several papers have proposed techniques to prevent this, assuming that the use of the service is considered sensitive. In this paper we investigate the more general case in which the adversary is also able to recognize traces of LBS requests by the same anonymous user, so that the identification of the issuer of one request can lead to the disclosure of the same user being in other possibly sensitive locations at different times or using sensitive services.Using the notion of ""historical k-anonymity"", this paper provides the first formalization of this class of privacy threats. Through extensive experiments based on realistic simulations, and runs of an optimal algorithm, we show some negative results for the defenses based on spatial generalization against these attacks under very conservative assumptions. Under more realistic location knowledge assumptions, we propose two defense algorithms, based on a strategy of changing and reusing of pseudo-identifiers, whose correctness is formally proved.

It combines design pattern candidate sets coming from different tools implementing different DPD techniques. We show that a design pattern can be a witness for the existence of another pattern. Our approach is able (1) to provide correct diagnostics even if the inputs from the evaluated tools were partly wrong and (2) to detect patterns instances not identified by the individual tools. For the Decorator, Visitor and Observer pattern, the witness-based approach yields better precision and recall than provided by any single tool. In particular, it detects 24 out of 30 instances of these patterns missed in our experiments by the evaluated tools.

It is no surprise, then, that under the grid and cluster paradigms, middlewares and other large-scale applications often seek caching solutions. Among these distributed applications, scientific workflow management systems have gained ground towards mitigating the often painstaking process of composing sequences of scientific data sets and services to derive virtual data. In the past, workflow managers have relied on low-level system cache for reuse support. But in distributed query intensive environments, where high volumes of intermediate virtual data can potentially be stored anywhere on the grid, a novel cache structure is needed to efficiently facilitate workflow planning. In this paper, we describe an approach to combat the challenges of maintaining large, fast virtual data caches for workflow composition. A hierarchical structure is proposed for indexing scientific data with spatiotemporal annotations across grid nodes. Our experimental results show that our hierarchical index is scalable and outperforms a centralized indexing scheme by an exponential factor in query intensive environments.","","POD:978-1-4244-3935-5","10.1109/CCGRID.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071876","grid workflows;scientific workflows;workflow cache;workflow management","Application software;Computer science;Data mining;Grid computing;Indexing;Information retrieval;Middleware;Pervasive computing;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Workflow management software","cache storage;grid computing;indexing;middleware;natural sciences computing;planning;query processing;workflow management software;workstation clusters","cluster paradigms;distributed query intensive environments;grid workflows;hierarchical caches;middlewares;personal software;scientific data indexing;scientific workflow management systems;spatiotemporal annotations;workflow composition;workflow planning","","5","","27","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, efficient data scheduling schemes are needed to fully exploit the benefits of data broadcasting. This motivated the proposal of several broadcast scheduling policies, which have mostly focused on either minimizing response time, or drop rate when requests are associated with hard deadlines. The inherent inaccuracy of hard deadlines in a dynamic mobile environment motivated us to use Service Level Agreements (SLAs) where a user specifies the utility of data as a function of its arrival time. Moreover, SLAs provide the mobile user with an already familiar quality of service specification from wired environments. Hence, in this paper, we propose SAAB which is an SLA-aware adaptive data broadcast scheduling policy for maximizing the system utility under SLA-based performance measures. To achieve this goal, SAAB considers both the characteristics of disseminated data objects as well as the SLAs associated with them. Additionally, SAAB automatically adjusts to the system workload conditions which enables it to constantly outperform existing on-demand broadcast scheduling policies.","1551-6245;15516245","POD:978-1-4244-4153-2","10.1109/MDM.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088929","","Bandwidth;Computer network management;Delay;Digital multimedia broadcasting;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Multimedia communication;Processor scheduling;Usability;Wireless networks","data communication;quality of service;radio broadcasting;radio networks;scheduling","SLA-aware adaptive on-demand data broadcasting;data scheduling schemes;mobile networks;quality of service;service level agreements;wireless networks","","2","","22","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SIFT descriptors, which are invariant to image scaling and transformation and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine, present the local features of an image. Therefore, feature keypoints can be extracted more accurately by using SIFT from user-defined ROI of an image than color, texture, shape and spatial relations feature.

In this paper, we focus on trouble-shooting problem tickets in an IT service management system. In such a system, problems are typically reported using vague user-generated descriptions of the symptoms (e.g., 'my email is not working!') in a ticket. IT Specialists are then responsible for identifying the troubled component from the reported symptoms. Usually, the ticket is sent to one Specialist at a time until it is resolved hence, an efficient mechanism to select the (next) potential Specialist becomes critical towards a timely resolution of the ticket. In this paper, we introduce a framework to deal with fuzzy requests in a distributed environment. We first show the importance of considering both the traditional graph-based network routing efficiency as well as social network theory to generate important ranking metrics. For each newly arrived ticket, we propose several selection and ranking policies to choose and rank IT Specialists who can potentially resolve the ticket. We evaluate the ranking system with synthetic tickets, generated by an in-depth simulated IT management model that closely mimics an operational system. Our preliminary results suggest the importance of considering both routing efficiency and social connectivity to minimize the resolution time of a ticket.","","POD:978-1-4244-3968-3","10.1109/INFCOMW.2009.5072095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5072095","","Application software;Computer networks;Computer science;Databases;Fuzzy systems;Information retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Social network services;Web sites","DP management;fuzzy set theory;graph theory","IT service management system;distributed environment;fuzzy request;graph-based network routing;rank computation framework;social network theory;vague user-generated description","","0","","10","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A small hardware module is used to manage the sequential retrieval of checksums each time the integrity of the data accessed by the processor sub-system needs to be verified.

In this work we present a new approach for peer-to-peer data indexing, focused on organization and retrieval of metadata which describes the shared content. This approach results in a common and interoperable infrastructure, which provides a transparent access to data shared on multiple data sharing networks via a simple API.

AWA provides a well-suited schema to deal with these phenomena. The annotation model relies on XML technologies for data representation, storage and retrieval. Typed feature structures are used as a representation schema for linguistic analyses. A consistent underlying data model, which captures the structure and relations contained in the information to be manipulated, has been identified and implemented. AWA is integrated into LPAF, a multilayered Language Processing and Annotation Framework, whose goal is the management and integration of diverse NLP components and resources.

In this paper we present COSINE, a context management framework for mobile environments. COSINE has been developed on the principles of peer-to-peer computing and establishes context sharing infrastructures consisting of loosely coupled Web services. The services represent modular entities of the applied context model and manage the retrieval, aggregation, query, and provision of context data. Clients access the distributed information transparently via proxies and a self-adaptive routing of queries provides increased fault-tolerance, which is essential in mobile environments.","1551-6245;15516245","POD:978-1-4244-4153-2","10.1109/MDM.2009.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089008","","Context modeling;Context-aware services;Environmental management;Fault tolerance;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Query processing;Routing;Web services","Web services;information retrieval;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing","COSINE framework;adaptive query routing;context-awareness;distributed context;loosely coupled Web services;mobile computing;mobile networks;mobile systems;peer-to-peer computing","","6","","18","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our objectives are to explore a given geographic region by detecting spatio-temporal events of interest and to store these events in the network until the user requests them. Such a setting finds applications in mobile environments where the user (i.e., the sink) is infrequently within communication range from the field deployment. Our framework, coined SenseSwarm, dynamically partitions the sensing devices into perimeter and core nodes. Data acquisition is scheduled at the perimeter, in order to minimize energy consumption, while storage and replication takes place at the core nodes which are physically and logically shielded to threats and obstacles. To efficiently identify the nodes laying on the perimeter of the swarm we devise the Perimeter Algorithm (PA), an efficient distributed algorithm with a low communication complexity. For storage and fault-tolerance we devise the Data Replication Algorithm (DRA), a voting-based replication scheme that enables the exact retrieval of events from the network in cases of failures. Our trace-driven experimentation shows that our framework can offer significant energy reductions while maintaining high data availability rates. In particular, we found that when failures are less than 60% failure then we can recover over 80% of generated events exactly.","1551-6245;15516245","POD:978-1-4244-4153-2","10.1109/MDM.2009.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088940","Data Replication;Mobile Sensor Networks;Perimeter Construction","Availability;Complexity theory;Data acquisition;Distributed algorithms;Energy consumption;Energy storage;Event detection;Fault tolerance;Information retrieval;Mobile communication","distributed processing;mobile radio","SenseSwarm;distributed algorithm;mobile sensor network;perimeter-based data replication;voting-based replication scheme","","3","","30","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key representation auditing scheme is proposed to protect online and dynamic SDBs from being disclosed. The core idea is to convert the original database D into key representation database D, and each new user query q should be converted from string representation into key representation query q and stored in the Audit Query table (AQ table). We propose three audit stages to repel the attacks of the snooper to the confidentiality of the individuals. These stages enable the key representation auditor (KRA) to conveniently specify the illegal queries which could lead to disclosing the SDB. The proposed scheme that will be applied guarantees the security of SDBs and provides precise and accurate responses, besides it needs less CPU time and storage space during query processing.","","POD:978-0-7695-3595-1","10.1109/ICIME.2009.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5077044","auditing;compromise;confidentiality;statistical database","Data engineering;Data security;Databases;Information management;Information retrieval;Law;Protection;Query processing;Secure storage;Statistical analysis","query processing;security of data;statistical databases","Audit Query table;key representation auditing scheme;query processing;statistical databases;statistical information retrieval;statistical queries","","2","","6","","","3-5 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web search engines (WSEs) have started to help users with this matter. However, these types of application, to perform more effectively, always need current information about many characteristics of the Web. To determine these characteristics, one way is to use statistical sampling of the Web pages. In this kind of approaches, instead of analyzing a large number of Web pages, a rather smaller and more uniform set of Web pages is used. This research attempts to analyze the presented methods for generating uniform samples of the pages from the World Wide Web. It specifically focuses on a new method called BBS. Briefly, we improved BBS at least by 4.45% regarding the uniformity of the samples. Using this improved BBS, we estimated the size of the public indexable Web at 27.4 Billion pages.

Both system components use a common maximum entropy framework, which allows the integration of a large array of feature types, including lexical, morphological, syntactic, and semantic features. Arabic offers additional challenges for this task (when compared with English, for example), as segmentation is a needed processing step, so one can correctly identify and resolve enclitic pronouns.

For this study, citation counts and rankings of 1,364,757 articles were analyzed. Some results of our first study were confirmed: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar's ranking algorithm. Highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that are cited less often. Therefore, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for searching standard literature than for gems or articles by authors advancing a view different from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. In some cases no correlation existed; in others bizarre patterns were recognizable, suggesting that citation counts sometimes have no impact at all on articles' rankings.","2151-1349;21511349","POD:978-1-4244-2864-9","10.1109/RCIS.2009.5089308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089308","Academic Search Engines;Citation Counts;Empirical Study;Google Scholar;Ranking Algorithm","Citation analysis;Computer science;Databases;Filtering algorithms;Information filtering;Information retrieval;Pattern recognition;Search engines;Software libraries;Web search","citation analysis;query processing;search engines","Google Scholar ranking algorithm;academic articles;citation counts;hghly cited articles;major academic search engines;reverse-engineering;search query;standard literature","","7","","16","","","22-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These algorithms have high applicability for vehicular wireless environs characterized by high Doppler frequencies which leads to faster auto-correlation averaging. In this paper, we propose to improve upon the classical ESPRIT algorithm by incorporating the iterative reduced rank Hankel approximation (RRHA) technique.

Therefore XML query processing over large volumes of data needs to make the most out of already spent processing time by caching common (sub)expressions for reuse. This is especially promising for the new paradigm of personalized preference queries. Here a sequence of possible query relaxations is a-priori determined by the users' preferences. Structural and value-based preferences thus define a query process where predicates are progressively relaxed until a suitable set of best possible results has been retrieved. To improve evaluation times for such query processes we argue that caching intermediate join results of structural preference queries is especially effective, because subsequent queries will always be subsumed by some previously cached queries to a certain extent. In this paper we propose a structural join-based caching scheme that allows preference queries to reuse the most beneficial structural join results of all previous queries. We first design a twig cache along with effective strategies for cache management. Moreover, we present a selection algorithm for join orders using cached data and the preference-induced sequence of future queries to select optimal query evaluation plans. Our benchmark experiments show that by using our twig caches preference query processing can be essentially sped up.","2151-1349;21511349","POD:978-1-4244-2864-9","10.1109/RCIS.2009.5089300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089300","XML databases;caching;preference-based retrieval;query processing","Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Floods;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Query processing;Statistics;XML","XML;cache storage;query processing","XML query processing;benchmark experiments;intermediate join results caching;join order selection algorithm;preference query processing;query relaxations;structural preferences;twig caches;value-based preferences","","1","","19","","","22-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially the system is alerted to the presence of a phishing page upon receiving the Phisherpsilas solicitation e-mail. Next the system retrieves the location, IP address and contact information of the host server using a tracking program. Finally, the system sends notification to the Administrator about the phishing page on its server. It is then up to the host server Administrator to remove the phishing page from its server, or face the possibility of criminals continuing to use their site.

In this paper we thus present a neurofunctional forward model of a hippocampal comparator function based on Vinogradovas theory of theta-regulated attention. Subsequently we integrated this comparator model into a multiscale framework for the simulation of evoked responses. The results of our simulations were compared to experimental data on electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of habituation towards familiar stimuli.

When a mobile node transmits query and reply messages, our method can be used to reduce candidates of data items included in the top-k result to prevent unnecessary data transmissions. Moreover, if a mobile node detects a disconnection of a radio link, it searches for an alternative path to transmit the reply message to the query-issuing node.

This paper takes land surface temperature (LST) as the instruction factor of thermal feature, and selects satellite TM images acquired at different urban development stages to analyze the relationship between LST variation and urban sprawl. Then, together with Beijing wetland 2007 census data, the relationship between urban wetlands and urban thermal environment and the change of LST in different wetland buffer distance are analyzed with GIS spatial analysis techniques. (1) Due to the urban sprawl and the thermal inertia feature change of land surface, the variation of thermal feature is more and more serious, which is tied together with the urban development. On the other hand, during the retrieval of land surface temperature, if the content of atmospheric water vapor is calculated with remote sensing data and monitoring data observed with ground stations respectively, the difference of LST results is bigger in hill than plain zone. (2) Because wetland landscape and urban other surface has a significant difference in the thermal feature, spatial distribution of wetland and low-temperature zone in urban region are a very good positive correlation. Further more, analyses of relationship between wetlands and land surface temperature in different buffer distance have been done. Mean of the maximum regulation distance is about 267.34 meters for the typical urban wetlands.","2334-0932;23340932","POD:978-1-4244-3460-2","10.1109/URS.2009.5137701","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137701","","Geographic Information Systems;Image analysis;Information retrieval;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Remote monitoring;Remote sensing;Satellites;Temperature sensors;Thermal factors","atmospheric humidity;geographic information systems;geophysics computing;hydrology;land surface temperature;remote sensing","Beijing wetland 2007 census data;GIS spatial analysis techniques;atmospheric water vapor;energy circulation;land surface temperature;low-temperature zone;remote sensing;satellite TM images;thermal inertia feature;urban development;urban energy budget characteristics;urban land surface feature;urban sprawl;urban thermal characteristics effect","","1","","18","","","20-22 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ajax technology, with which web applications can retrieve data from the server asynchronously in the background without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page, has gained popularity recently. The article aims to present a web-based building management system (BMS) based on Ajax and Web Services for realizing real-time monitoring and control of BAS on the Internet. The BMS is applied to a BAS within a BACnet network. Some public Web Services methods, which can read and write BACnet data points from the BACnet network, are developed based on a BACnet protocol stack. These Web Services methods can be invoked by other applications to realize BAS integration and interoperation with enterprise applications on the Internet. By invoking the Web Services to get real-time data in the BACnet network, Ajax, which can provide a rich-client browser application, is adopted to design the web GUIs of the BMS.","","POD:978-0-7695-3560-9","10.1109/ISBIM.2008.220","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5116422","Ajax;Building automation system;Building management system;Web Services","Automation;Buildings;Communications technology;Displays;Information retrieval;Middleware;Real time systems;Web and internet services;Web server;Web services","Web services;building management systems;middleware;office automation","Ajax technology;BACnet protocol stack;Internet communication technologies;Web-based building management system;building automation system;middleware technology;public Web services methods","","3","","7","","","19-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is not sufficient to ensure that the architecture actually meets the specified requirements (as some requirements lead to architectural decisions, establish trade-offs, etc). Equally, without knowledge of such traceability relationships it becomes very difficult to predict change impact and thus understand the causes of system instability. In order to improve this situation, we have developed a concern-oriented dependency taxonomy that enables us to capture the dependency relationships between requirements-level concerns and their manifestation at the architectural level. We have applied the dependency taxonomy on a real-world case study to explore and identify unstable architectural components, which are most likely to be impacted by change.","","POD:978-1-4244-3719-1","10.1109/EA.2009.5071583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071583","","Computer architecture;Conferences;Design engineering;Information retrieval;Lead;Natural language processing;Project management;Scattering;Stability analysis;Taxonomy","formal specification;object-oriented programming;program diagnostics;software architecture;software maintenance","architectural component;aspect oriented requirement engineering;concern tracing;concern-oriented dependency taxonomy;program change impact analysis;requirement-level concern;traceability","","1","","16","","","18-18 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional way uses order-preserving hashing functions to create value indexes that are placed and stored on the corresponding peers to support range query. The way, however, suffers from high index maintenance costs. To avoid the issue, a scalable blind search method over DHTs - recursive partition search (RPS) can be used. But, RPS still easily incurs high network overhead as network size grows. Thus, in this paper, a learning-aware RPS (LARPS) is proposed to overcome the disadvantages of two approaches above mentioned. Extensive experiments show LARPS is a scalable and robust approach for range query, especially in the following cases: (a) query range is wide, (b) the requested resources follow Zipf distribution, and (c) the number of required resources is small.","","POD:978-1-4244-3935-5","10.1109/CCGRID.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071870","DHT;P2P;Range query","Chaos;Computer networks;Costs;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Information retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Robustness;Scalability;Search methods","file organisation;peer-to-peer computing;query processing","DHT-based peer-to-peer network;Zipf distribution;distributed hash table;index maintenance cost;learning-aware RPS;order-preserving hashing function;range query;recursive partition search;scalable blind search method","","2","","26","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is essentially a spectrum estimation problem. As a consequence, complex values of a specific range cell in a SAR image stack as a function of baseline are closely related to the Fourier transform of the reflectivity function in the elevation direction. The new generation of SAR satellites, like TerraSAR-X, allow for the first time the building up of high-resolution SAR data stacks on a regular basis. TerraSAR-X in its high resolution spotlight mode provides data with 0.6 m slant range resolution. It has already been shown that persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) benefits enormously from this new quality of data. The data stacks used for PSI in urban areas can also be used to derive tomographic information. This paper presents the first demonstration of space-borne high resolution tomographic reconstruction of multiple scatterers in a resolution cell situation in urban areas. Different spectrum estimation strategies such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Nonlinear Least Squares estimation (NLS) are evaluated and compared using both simulated data and TerraSAR-X spotlight data over Las Vegas with special consideration of the difficulties caused by sparse and irregular samples. The nuisance of ill-conditioning is investigated and regularization tools are utilized to overcome this problem. For validation, the spectrum estimation results with TerraSAR-X data are compared to the plausible ground truth. In a second step of processing model selection criteria such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Minimum Description Length criterion (MDL) are implemented on the spectral estimates to determine the number of scatterers inside a resolution cell. The probability of correctly detecting the number of scatterers and the accuracy of the corresponding elevation estimates are evaluated from simulated data.- Additionally, model selection results with TerraSAR-X data are analyzed. Finally, SAR tomography, as a straightforward extension to PSL is integrated into DLRs PSI-GENESIS processor to support deformation estimation and solve the ambiguity due to multiple scatterers inside a resolution cell. First processing results using TerraSAR-X data are presented that confirm the capability of space-borne high resolution SAR tomography for resolving multiple targets within the same azimuth-range cell and to map the 3-D scattering properties of the illuminated scene.","2334-0932;23340932","POD:978-1-4244-3460-2","10.1109/URS.2009.5137534","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137534","SAR tomography;TerraSAR-X;model selection;persistent scatterer interferometry;spectral estimation","Fourier transforms;Information retrieval;Radar scattering;Reflectivity;Satellites;Spaceborne radar;Spectral analysis;Synthetic aperture radar;Tomography;Urban areas","geophysical techniques;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;tomography","3D reflectivity;Akaike information criterion;Bayesian Information Criterion;Las Vegas;Minimum Description Length criterion;Nonlinear Least Squares estimation;PSI-GENESIS processor;Singular Value Decomposition;TS-X Data;TerraSAR-X satellite;persistent scatterer interferometry;space borne high resolution SAR tomography;spectrum estimation;synthetic aperture radar;urban environment","","6","","16","","","20-22 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
