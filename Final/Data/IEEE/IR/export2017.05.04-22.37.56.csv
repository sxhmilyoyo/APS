One reason is because search engines also look at non-informative blocks of Web pages such as advertisement, navigation links, etc. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm called FastContentExtractor to automatically detect main content blocks in a Web page by improving the ContentExtractor algorithm. By automatically identifying and storing templates representing the structure of content blocks in a website, content blocks of a new Web page from the Website can be extracted quickly. The hierarchical order of the output blocks is also maintained which guarantees that the extracted content blocks are in the same order as the original ones.","","POD:978-1-4244-5086-2","10.1109/KSE.2009.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361702","data mining;template detection;web mining","Data mining;Educational institutions;Humans;Internet;Knowledge engineering;Laboratories;Navigation;Search engines;Systems engineering and theory;Web pages","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval;search engines","ContentExtractor algorithm;FastContentExtractor;Internet;Web page;Websites;fast template-based approach;information browsing;primary text content;search engines;templates storing","","4","","16","","","13-17 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mirroring, a popular solution, is too expensive over time. We present a compromise solution that uses multi-level redundancy coding to reduce the probability of data loss from multiple simultaneous device failures. This approach handles small-scale failures of one or two devices efficiently while still allowing the system to survive rare-event, larger-scale failures of four or more devices. In our approach, each disk is split into a set of fixed size disklets which are used to construct reliability stripes. To protect against rare event failures, reliability stripes are grouped into larger super-groups, each of which has a corresponding super-parity; super-parity is only used to recover data when disk failures overwhelm the redundancy in a single reliability stripe. Super-parity can be stored on a variety of devices such as NV-RAM and always-on disks to offset write bottlenecks while still keeping the number of active devices low. Our calculations of failure probabilities show that adding super-parity allows our system to absorb many more disk failures without data loss. Through discrete event simulation, we found that adding super-groups has a significant impact on mean time to data loss and that rebuilds are slow but not unmanageable. Finally, we showed that robustness against rare events can be achieved for a fraction of total system cost.","1526-7539;15267539","POD:978-1-4244-4927-9","10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366825","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366825","","Cooling;Costs;Data engineering;Insurance;Power system protection;Power system reliability;Redundancy;Reliability engineering;Robustness;Surge protection","discrete event simulation;information retrieval systems;records management","NV-RAM;archival systems;digital archives;discrete event simulation;rare event failure protection;rare event failures;super-parity","","9","16","32","","","21-23 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The efficacy of this process is strictly connected with the possibility of an automatic detection of preference profiles, through the analysis of the users' behavior during their interactions with the system. The definition of such profiles should take into account imprecision and gradedness, two features that justify the use of fuzzy sets for their representation. This paper proposes a model for representing preference profiles through fuzzy sets. The model's strategy for adapting profiles to user preferences is to record the sequence of accessed resources by each user, and to update preference profiles accordingly so as to suggest similar resources at next user accesses. Profile adaption is performed continuously, but in earlier stages it is more sensitive to updates (plastic phase) while in later stages it is less sensitive (stable phase) to allow resource suggestion. Simulation results are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","2164-7143;21647143","POD:978-1-4244-4735-0","10.1109/ISDA.2009.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364459","Dynamic User Profiling;Fuzzy Logic;Recommender Systems","Adaptive systems;Application software;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Informatics;Information analysis;Intelligent systems;Navigation;Plastics;Software systems","fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);user modelling","adaptive fuzzy profile;adaptive software system;fuzzy sets;preference profile detection;preference profile learning;preference profile representation;profile adaption;resource access;resource suggestion;system behavior;user behavior analysis;user personalization;user preference modeling","","4","","10","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work a theme detection technique has been evolved for more generic domain independent subjectivity detection that classifies sentences with binary feature: opinionated or non-opinionated. Theme detection technique examines sentence level opinion and finally accumulates the opinion clues to reach the discourse level subjectivity.

We have implemented this mechanism as a tool, which is called OperationReplayer. The tool allows a developer to investigate detected candidates of stagnation periods and replay operations belonging to the candidate through its graphical user interface.

It allows users to tag music items like songs, albums, or artists. Social tags are valuable to MIR, because they comprise a multifaced source of information about genre, style, mood, users' opinion, or instrumentation. In this paper, we examine the problem of personalized music recommendation based on social tags. We propose the modeling of social tagging data with three-order tensors, which capture cubic (three-way) correlations between users-tags-music items. The discovery of latent structure in this model is performed with the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), which helps to provide accurate and personalized recommendations, i.e., adapted to the particular users' preferences. To address the sparsity that incurs in social tagging data and further improve the quality of recommendation, we propose to enhance the model with a tag-propagation scheme that uses similarity values computed between the music items based on audio features. As a result, the proposed model effectively combines both information about social tags and audio features. The performance of the proposed method is examined experimentally with real data from Last.fm. Our results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods that suppress the cubic relationships that are inherent in social tagging data. Additionally, our results suggest that the combination of social tagging data with audio features is preferable than the sole use of the former.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2033973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280358","Audio similarity;Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD);music recommendation;social tags;tensors","","identification technology;information retrieval;music;recommender systems;singular value decomposition","MusicBox;audio features;higher order singular value decomposition;multifaced information source;music information retrieval;personalized music recommendation;social tags cubic analysis;tag propagation scheme;three order tensors","","31","","14","","20091006","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Ensuring efficient access to such large and widely distributed datasets is hindered by high latencies. Effective scheduling in grid can reduce the amount of data transferred among nodes by dispatching a job to node where most of the required data is available. In addition to efficient scheduling, dynamic replication strategies are regarded as one of the major optimization technique for reducing access latency. In this paper, we propose a two-phase dynamic replication strategy coupled with two-stage job scheduling to provide an integrated environment for efficient access to data and job scheduling.

Firstly, a feature vector is set up for each candidate tag, which contains tag co-occurrence information. Then a ranking model is trained with TR-CRF, and the ranking score represents the relevance between a candidate tag and a resource.

Island-driven search addresses this problem by first identifying reliable islands and directing the search out from these islands towards unreliable gaps. In this paper, we develop a technique to detect islands from knowledge of hypothesized broad phonetic classes (BPCs). Using this island/gap knowledge, we explore a method to prune the search space to limit computational effort in unreliable areas. In addition, we also investigate scoring less detailed BPC models in gap regions and more detailed phonetic models in islands.

"Chinese Named Entity Recognition Using a Morpheme-Based Chunking Tagger","G. Fu","Sch. of Comput.

However, it is difficult under this formulation to explore lexical information for NER. Furthermore, traditional NER chunking systems usually employ an exhaustive strategy for entity candidate generation, obviously resulting in efficiency loss during entity decoding. In this paper we propose a morpheme-based chunking framework for Chinese NER and implement an efficient three-stage tagger using the pipeline strategy. To tackle the problem of out-of-vocabulary words and to more effectively explore lexical cues for NER as well, we distinguish named entities from common words and choose morphemes as the basic tokens for entity chunking. To reduce the space of entity candidates and improve the efficiency of entity decoding, we employ internal entity formation pattern rules during entity candidate generation. Our experiments on different datasets show that our system can greatly improve NER efficiency without much degradation of performance.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3904-1; POD:978-1-4244-5318-4","10.1109/IALP.2009.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380751","entity pattern rules;morpheme-based chunking;named entity recognition","Character recognition;Computer science;Data mining;Decoding;Degradation;Filtering;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Pattern recognition;Pipelines","decoding;information retrieval systems;natural language processing;pattern recognition","Chinese named entity recognition;NER chunking systems;entity candidate generation;entity decoding;lexicon words;morpheme-based chunking tagger","","0","","11","","","7-9 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recommender systems face this problem filtering relevant resources connected to users' interests and preferences. In particular, collaborative filtering recommender systems produce suggestions using the opinions of similar users, called the neighbors.

Statistical machine translation used to automatically annotates the image. This approach considers image annotation as the translation of image regions to words, similar to the translation of text from one language to another. The ""lexicon"" for the translation is learned from large annotated image collections, which consist of images that are associated with text. Images are segmented into regions with grid segmentation. A pre-specified feature vector represents each region. The regions then clustered into a finite set of blobs. The correspondences between the blobs and the words are learned using Expectation Maximization algorithm. These correspondences are used to predict words associated with whole images (auto-annotation). The auto-annotation performance is evaluated using Normalized Score (E<sub>NS</sub>) algorithm. The experimental results show that the average precision of clause queries achieved best result than word queries, 0.544 and 0.251 for clause queries and word queries respectively. The proposed method of latent semantic indexing succeeds to exploit semantic value of automatic-annotation-based image retrieval.","","POD:978-1-4244-5330-6","10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5370355","Content-based image retrieval;automatic annotation;latent semantic indexing;statistical machine translation","Computer applications;Constraint optimization;Containers;Design optimization;Image retrieval;Indexing;Integer linear programming;Pattern recognition;Printing;Testing","content-based retrieval;expectation-maximisation algorithm;image retrieval;image segmentation;information retrieval;language translation","automatic image annotation;expectation maximization algorithm;feature vector;grid segmentation;image retrieval;image semantic extraction;latent semantic indexing;normalized score algorithm;statistical machine translation","","0","","6","","","4-7 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, when part of Â¿namesÂ¿ of entities are used as their identifiers, the problem is often referred to as a mixed entity resolution problem, where goal is to sort out the erroneous entities due to name homonyms (e.g., if only last name is used as an identifier, one cannot distinguish Â¿Vannevar BushÂ¿ from Â¿George BushÂ¿). Especially, a mixed entity resolution problem is common on the Web data. For instance, to search for a product name (e.g., Oracle) in Google, there exist a mixture of web pages due to the name homonyms (e.g., Oracle Database, Oracle Audio, Oracle Academy, etc.). In this paper, we present a practical system for resolving such mixed entities on the Web. For development of such a system, we propose a Web service based interface, an unsupervised clustering scheme, and cluster ranking algorithms. In particular, since the correct number of clusters is often unknown, we study a state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering solution based on propagation of pairwise similarities of entities.

This paper describes a semantically-enhanced scientific resource library portlet that extends the traditional document library to enable interaction with multiple distributed repositories in the cloud and to broaden the set of resources that can be viewed beyond simple hierarchical document folder-files structure to include people, sensors, data streams and other complex digital entities and their relationships.

On the one hand, the model proposes an index-based extracting method of question-answering pairs, to combine the extraction with the index mechanism for improving the speed of extraction. On the other hand, the model expands the user's question at the concept level, and proposes a concept based matching method between sentences, to match the user's question with the question-answering pairs. The concept based matching method concerns the synonymous meanings between sentences at the concept level.

Although biochemical principles, such as enzyme mechanics, have been developed to derive kinetic rate equations, measuring and providing parameters in the equations are expensive and laborious. Observe that many kinetic parameters have been experimentally measured in previous research, and recorded in published literatures. Instead of measuring kinetic parameters from experiments, one of the alternatives is to find parameters from literatures. However, the amount of such literatures is huge, and reading them is very time-consuming. About the previous research of kinetic parameters are focused on literature including kinetic parameters or not. In this paper, we present a software tool (KIND) for automatic extraction of kinetic parameters from full-length literatures. In order to help biologist easy to retrieve kinetic parameters information, KIND can automatic generate table format to present kinetic parameters information from literatures.

On top of that, we investigate generic approaches to the use of textual and visual structural information to predict the presence of the corresponding entity in the other modality.

A prototype decision support system of an agricultural product market is designed and developed in this paper. It can extract online price information of a certain agricultural product from Web sites of agricultural wholesale, predict the product price in the future months, and provide further decision support on such issues as which cities the product should be sent to for sale and which cities should be in the transport route. To achieve these goals, an algorithm named MDT-E (market data table extraction) is proposed to extract the maximum data table in a Web page. Based on the common practice that ""the price data are usually displayed in the largest table on a Web page with the structure of ""<td>"" and ""</td>"" tags"", our market data extraction algorithm detects the largest table on a Web page at first, then transforms the table into a DOM tree,and further obtains the node values of the ""<td>"" tags. This algorithm can automatically detect market data without an assigned data extraction region. The designed system uses a quadratic forcasting model of linear time series to predict the price, and compares the prediction results by using different time series and different sample data to find the best forecasting model to forecast the price in cites. In addition, it provides the decision support to determine the transport route based on the transport costs and product prices.","2155-1456;21551456","POD:978-0-7695-3876-1","10.1109/ICIII.2009.541","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5370515","Web data extraction;decision support;prediction","Agricultural products;Cities and towns;Data mining;Decision support systems;Economic forecasting;Marketing and sales;Predictive models;Product design;Prototypes;Web pages","Web sites;agricultural products;decision support systems;information retrieval;pricing;time series","DOM tree;Web page;Web sites;agricultural product market;decision support system;linear time series;market data table extraction;online price extraction","","0","","11","","","26-27 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, a Web information extraction model with path patterns constructed from a path pattern mining algorithm is proposed in this paper. Our experimental data set is obtained by randomly selecting news Web pages from the CNN website. With a reasonable tolerance threshold, the experimental results show that the average precision is above 99% and the average recall is 100% when we integrate Web information extraction with our path pattern mining algorithm.

The system returns only the exact piece of information in natural language for presentation to the users thus saving them from further web hits and searching through documents for their required information.","","POD:978-0-7695-3892-1","10.1109/ICCTD.2009.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5359692","Annotations;cellular systems;natural language;question answering systems","Cellular phones;Geography;Information technology;Mobile computing;Motion pictures;Natural languages;Prototypes;Software engineering;Telephony;Usability","Internet;information retrieval;mobile computing;natural language processing","Web based question answering system;mobile system;natural language annotation;t-expression format","","0","","8","","","13-15 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ideal is an intelligent guide taking care of the whole organization and execution in time. This is the main objective of the context-based Personalized Mobile Tourist Guide (PMTG). Tourist's profiles or visiting background is stored in a user model. This paper develops a user model based on information retrieval techniques to rank tourists preferences of POIs. The tour computation is solved using a guided local search metaheuristic which is fast and can produce solutions dynamically meeting the real-time requirements. By integrating various sources like GIS and existing databases or Webs, the PMTG is a mobile agent that selects attractions, plans an individual tour, provides navigational guidance and offers context-based service in any possible way with the help of a mobile device. Furthermore, it protects the tourist privacy.","","POD:978-1-4244-4754-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358326","Guided local search;context;mobile toursit guide;personalization","Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Economic indicators;Geographic Information Systems;Information security;Protection;Routing;Scheduling;Web pages","geographic information systems;information retrieval;mobile computing;software agents;travel industry","GIS database;Web database;guided local search metaheuristic;information retrieval techniques;intelligent guide;mobile agent;personalized mobile tourist guide","","0","","20","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing methods try to model the dependencies between candidates and terms with distance measure or sequential measure, which have been proven to be effective. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has been conducted on the combination of the two dependencies. In this paper, we propose a language model based method to combine both dependencies under a unified framework. Specifically, we first propose an order kernel based document representation for incorporating the sequential dependency, and then we combine it with the proximity kernel based document representation which is designed to model the distance dependency. Our experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the order kernel and show that a linear combination of both dependencies can improve the performance significantly over the baseline method.","","POD:978-1-4244-4754-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358122","dependency;distance;expert finding;language model;sequence","Automation;Intelligent systems;Kernel;Performance gain;Unified modeling language","expert systems;formal languages;information retrieval","distance dependency;expert finding task;kernel based document representation;language model;order kernel;proximity kernel;sequential dependency","","0","","7","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
